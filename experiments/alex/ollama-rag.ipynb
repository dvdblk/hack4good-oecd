According to the text, there is a need for more skilled technicians in various fields, particularly in areas related to emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and data science. The document highlights that there is a shortage of skilled technicians in the UK, with evidence suggesting that the share of the workforce with technician or intermediate-level skills is lower in the UK than in major competitors. Additionally, the document notes that graduates often quickly become dissatisfied with their roles due to the mundane nature of much technician work and the relatively low wages they earn, leading to high labour turnover amongst graduates in technician-level roles. To address these issues, the document proposes the development of connections between employers and providers of vocational education and training to keep pace with advances in technology and provide training programs that meet the needs of emerging technologies.'"
