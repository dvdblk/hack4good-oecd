When participants are describing their vision, encourage them to be aspirational and not held back by the reality of the present. The design intent behind this is to help groups shake off existing practical, policy or market constraints that might be blocking their long term thinking. A potential danger of encouraging this is that groups push the conversation into unrealistic or impractical territory. If this happens, acknowledge it before returning to the current reality and allowing the group to self-correct. There is more benefit in building a demanding – even an unrealistic – vision and then adjusting it than in being too cautious and not setting a stretching aspiration for future success. \n",

      "Text: Perhaps that is why people in Britain smile so much – because they have taken control and are now working hard to deliver what they value and care about. No-one seems that bothered that the economy is still flat rather than growing or that taxation is relatively high and people are less well off financially than a decade ago. Perhaps that’s because anything is better than the drawn out and deep recession that cost Britain so much pain post Brexit. \n",

Electric vehicles and carbon rationing help but continued population growth – particularly in London – is placing huge strains on water availability and contributing to wider environmental stress. Some wonder if cities are about to change fundamentally. Certainly, distributed networks and remote working mean that concentrated population is no longer absolutely required for success and, many would now say, has gone way past what is sustainable. \n",

At the ‘front-end’ is an intuitive graphic user interface that allows users to search or browse the database, setting user defined parameters such as the ‘time to impact’ relevance to particular domains (currently defence related) and stance (lead, follow, watch, counter) preferences.
