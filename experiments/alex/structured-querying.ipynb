      "● Expanded opportunities for participation in STEM and ensured that a more diverse range of people enter the science and technology workforce. We will learn from examples like AI and data science conversion courses, where we have invested up to £30 million to help people from underrepresented groups join the UK’s AI industry.\n",

The UK’s offer will be attractive to the world's best talent across all career stages, with easy access through our ‘high-skilled visa system’ (Global Talent, Start Up/Innovator, High Potential Individual, Scale Up and Graduate). UK researchers will participate in exchanges which deliver international links and establish new collaborations.\n",

      "The National Science and Technology Council will review this list annually to ensure that the UK keeps pace and continues to develop global competitive advantage - although there will be a high bar to major change given the need for long-term planning.\n",
      "● Create the environment for these technologies to flourish in the UK, using the other nine levers set out in this Framework. Where necessary, the government must\n",
      "be prepared to intervene to shape markets. We will develop a cross-government plan to optimise the science and technology system for each critical technology. Plans will be informed by analysis of the UK’s strategic interests and strengths, and other nations’ postures, using an ‘Own-Collaborate-Access’ framework as a guide. We will consider where reliable and resilient supply chains are needed, with established methods for securing goods, to enable companies to grow and protect the UK from supply shocks.\n",
      "The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology is working on a cross-government action plan for each of the critical technologies. Initial work will include:\n",
      "● Developing a pro-innovation approach to regulating AI, which will be detailed in a White Paper to be published in early 2023.\n",
      "● Publishing UK strategies for semiconductors and quantum technologies in early 2023.\n",
      "● Publishing ambitious Wireless Infrastructure Strategy, which sets out our R&D priorities for future telecoms including 6G\n",
      "● Establishing a strategic approach to Engineering Biology and its applications across the economy, by mid 2023, to maximise opportunities and mitigate the risks.\n",
      "● For each critical technology, establishing a plan to protect the strategic advantage that we develop from state threats.\n",
      "● Ensuring that emerging technologies such as Large Language Models can be used to support a more innovative public sector while managing the risks.\n",

      "  \"summary\": \"The section discusses the roles, qualifications, acquisition, and ongoing training of technicians in the UK space industry. It highlights the majority of technicians being employed in the upstream sector, with qualifications typically at level 4, and the common route of entry being vocational education and training. The evidence suggests a growing imbalance between supply and demand for technicians, leading to an increasing reliance on apprenticeship programs for in-house training. The report also emphasizes the need for government policy to guarantee sufficient training and apprenticeship schemes to meet the industry's demand for technicians. Employers are encouraged to invest in the career development of their technicians, but there are concerns about the quality of off-the-job training and the lack of technician registration. Overall, there is a significant and expanding role for technicians in the space industry, with a need for more in-house training and potential for increased popularity of technician registration.\"\n",

It highlights that technicians account for around 20% of the total workforce in space primes and specialist upstream manufacturers, while in organizations combining upstream manufacturing with downstream services, the share of technicians is much smaller, averaging under 5% of the total workforce. The study indicates that downstream firms and satellite operators accounted for fewer than 5% of the total number of technicians employed. The highly demanding and specialized nature of work in software, IT engineering services, and consultancy implies a preference for hiring individuals with at least a degree level qualification. Exceptions include a small number of vocationally educated IT technicians in database management and front-line helpdesk roles. The report suggests that the industry relies heavily on technicians in upstream manufacturing roles, and downstream firms and satellite operators employ a relatively small number of technicians. The need for technicians in the space sector is likely to remain focused on upstream manufacturing roles, with a small fraction employed in downstream organizations.

The apprentices are studying qualifications in mechanical, electrical, and electronics engineering, with a focus on reaching at least level 4 qualifications. Some apprenticeship schemes have been approved by professional bodies, leading to EngTech awards upon completion. Larger organizations distinguish between apprenticeship schemes targeting level 4/5 qualifications and those targeting level 3 qualifications, with the former focusing more on electrical/electronic engineering. One components manufacturer has become involved in a Higher Apprenticeship scheme, aiming to fill roles requiring project leadership. There are variations in the annual intake of apprentices across organizations, with different entry requirements and acceptable completion rates. Upstream manufacturers are also planning to set up apprenticeship schemes, primarily to address the difficulty of recruiting experienced technicians with specific skills.

       " '<section id=6.2>\\nA number of different types of technician work within the organisations that make up the space industry. In what follows, a range of typical technician roles will be described in order to provide the reader with a sense of the kinds of duties undertaken by those technicians. Before proceeding, three related qualifications to what follows should be noted.\\nFirst, none of the technician roles distinguished below are to be found in every organisation. As noted above, most of the organisations that specialise in providing services based on earth observation data, along with firms offering high-level software and systems engineering support for both upstream and downstream activities, simply do not employ technicians. In addition, few of the upstream manufacturers who employ the vast majority of the technicians found in the space industry employ all the types of technician listed below. For example, specialist composites technicians tend to found only in the larger space primes, while firms supplying electronics components tend not to employ mechanical assembly technicians. In the role descriptions that follow, an attempt will be made to provide a sense of the kind of organisation(s) in which particular technician roles are commonly found.\\nSecond, far from offering an exhaustive account of all the nuances and variations that arise in the case of real technician roles, the descriptions provided below portray ‘ideal types’ that are intended only to set out the broad features of the different kinds of technician found in the space industry. As a result, there may well be cases where the technicians employed by one particular firm are allocated a set of duties that combines elements of more than one of the roles described below, as for example: when the same technicians machine, assemble and test particular items; or when electrical and mechanical assembly duties are carried out by the same person; or where the boundaries between the roles occupied by more experienced technician and those occupied by less experienced and/or more practically inclined graduates become blurred. Such cases are only to be expected in an industry where the small size of many firms impedes the elaborate division of labour required for the creation of specialised technician roles. (This is a point which we shall return in Section 5 below.)\\nThird, over time a combination of accumulated experience and informal on-the-job training may lead to a situation where the performance and contribution made by a particular worker exceeds what is specified in his/her particular job role. Often, of course, this will be recognised through promotion to a new role. But the worker’s enhanced skills and competences may not be formally certificated, so the links between roles and formal qualifications may not always be as clear cut as it sometimes indicated below.\\nNotwithstanding these caveats, the following account should provide a reasonably accurate initial overview of the kind of roles occupied by people qualified to technician level in the space industry, and of the qualifications associated with each role.\\n</section>',\n",
       " '<section id=6.2.1>\\nThe first broad group of technicians consists of workers whose expertise lies in the area of mechanical engineering, broadly understood. Workers of this kind are to be found in 11 of the organisations visited for this project, all of which are of course situated in the upstream part of the space sector. Broadly speaking, such workers manufacture and/or assemble and/or test the mechanical components and assemblies that help to make up a satellite. More specific examples of the kind of roles filled by these workers are described below.\\n</section>',\n",
       " '<section id=6.2.1.1>\\nOne prominent task carried out by some – though not, as we shall elaborate below, all – mechanical engineering technicians who work in the space industry is machining.Typically, this involves the technician carrying out both manual and CNC milling, turning and drilling in order to produce a variety of components and sub-assemblies for satellites, including: the aluminium and composite panels that constitute a satellite’s basic structure; various optical components used for the thermal control of spacecraft; and parts for the scientific instruments, detectors, and optical devices that make up the satellite’s payload. Much of this work must be carried out to very fine tolerances, in some cases requiring the technicians to view the part being machined under a microscope. In the case of CNC devices, the operators will typically work from 3-D CAD drawings provided either by technicians occupying the role of manufacturing or production engineer (see Section 4.2.1 [d] below) or by graduate-level engineers, but will programme, set and operate CNC machines themselves. Machinists may also be involved in making the mould tools, jigs and fixtures required for the manufacture and assembly of novel metal and composite parts.\\nTechnicians engaged in machining were found in nine of the 11 upstream organisations that employ mechanical engineering technicians.They are most numerous in the case of organisations that manufacture components and sub-assemblies for satellites but can also be found – in smaller numbers – in the space primes. In both the larger, specialist component manufacturers, and also in the space primes, machinists tend to have done some kind of manufacturing engineering apprenticeship at level 3. In the smaller organisations, especially those involved in the manufacture of bespoke instruments, machinists tend to be qualified to level 4 or even 5, having taken an HNC or even in some cases an HND. Perhaps this ought not to be too surprising, given that in the cases where novel instruments are being made, technicians may not only manufacture the instrument but may also have an input into its design, a task that demands a higher level of expertise than mass-producing standardised items (see Section 4.2.1 [d] below).\\nTwo of the larger organisations have dedicated roles for machinists, whose incumbents specialised in machining – as distinct from assembling and testing - components. In other cases, the task of machining parts was combined with other duties - such as those of fitting the components together to form larger sub-assemblies and/or testing the item that is thereby produced - to form a\\nsingle, multi-dimensional role.This brings us to the next kind of task carried out by workers with mechanical engineering skills, namely that of mechanical assembly.\\n</section>']"

      "Having discussed the origins of the case study organisations’ current technicians, we move on now to consider how the organisations in question propose to satisfy their future need for technicians.That is to say, we shall consider in this section the workforce planning strategies adopted by those space companies that employ technicians.This is an interesting and important issue, for a number of reasons.The first is that, as noted above, the increasingly difficulty of recruiting experienced technicians means that the approach most commonly adopted hitherto, namely recruitment-plus-upgrading, may not be as sustainable in the future as it was in the past. Second, many of the case study organisations, including seven of the 12 who are either currently training apprentices or are planning to do so – are growing, often very rapidly, and require increasing numbers of technicians. Of course, this reflects the more general point – made above – that the space industry is growing rapidly, both in terms of the value of its business and also in terms of total employment. It is also worth noting in this context a point made by three firms in particular, namely that as these firms grow the number of technicians may rise as a share of their total employment.The reason is as follows.The firms in question are currently rather small, both in terms of the volume of business they have and also in terms of total employment.Their small size is significant, because it means that in the past they had little or no scope to employ specialist technicians, simply because they have not had enough technician-type work to warrant employing a specialist of that kind. (Typically, the technician-type work has instead been done by graduates.11)  However, as the volume of business undertaken by the firms expands, there arises a point at which it becomes worthwhile for the firms in question to employ specialist technicians in some parts of their business.There is some reason to think, therefore, that as at least some space companies move from very small-scale batch manufacturing of bespoke commercial satellites to building (somewhat) more standardised products, the number of specialist technicians employed will grow as a share of the manufacturing workforce.\n",
