      "● Expanded opportunities for participation in STEM and ensured that a more diverse range of people enter the science and technology workforce. We will learn from examples like AI and data science conversion courses, where we have invested up to £30 million to help people from underrepresented groups join the UK’s AI industry.\n",

The UK’s offer will be attractive to the world's best talent across all career stages, with easy access through our ‘high-skilled visa system’ (Global Talent, Start Up/Innovator, High Potential Individual, Scale Up and Graduate). UK researchers will participate in exchanges which deliver international links and establish new collaborations.\n",

      "The National Science and Technology Council will review this list annually to ensure that the UK keeps pace and continues to develop global competitive advantage - although there will be a high bar to major change given the need for long-term planning.\n",
      "● Create the environment for these technologies to flourish in the UK, using the other nine levers set out in this Framework. Where necessary, the government must\n",
      "be prepared to intervene to shape markets. We will develop a cross-government plan to optimise the science and technology system for each critical technology. Plans will be informed by analysis of the UK’s strategic interests and strengths, and other nations’ postures, using an ‘Own-Collaborate-Access’ framework as a guide. We will consider where reliable and resilient supply chains are needed, with established methods for securing goods, to enable companies to grow and protect the UK from supply shocks.\n",
      "The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology is working on a cross-government action plan for each of the critical technologies. Initial work will include:\n",
      "● Developing a pro-innovation approach to regulating AI, which will be detailed in a White Paper to be published in early 2023.\n",
      "● Publishing UK strategies for semiconductors and quantum technologies in early 2023.\n",
      "● Publishing ambitious Wireless Infrastructure Strategy, which sets out our R&D priorities for future telecoms including 6G\n",
      "● Establishing a strategic approach to Engineering Biology and its applications across the economy, by mid 2023, to maximise opportunities and mitigate the risks.\n",
      "● For each critical technology, establishing a plan to protect the strategic advantage that we develop from state threats.\n",
      "● Ensuring that emerging technologies such as Large Language Models can be used to support a more innovative public sector while managing the risks.\n",

      "  \"summary\": \"The section discusses the roles, qualifications, acquisition, and ongoing training of technicians in the UK space industry. It highlights the majority of technicians being employed in the upstream sector, with qualifications typically at level 4, and the common route of entry being vocational education and training. The evidence suggests a growing imbalance between supply and demand for technicians, leading to an increasing reliance on apprenticeship programs for in-house training. The report also emphasizes the need for government policy to guarantee sufficient training and apprenticeship schemes to meet the industry's demand for technicians. Employers are encouraged to invest in the career development of their technicians, but there are concerns about the quality of off-the-job training and the lack of technician registration. Overall, there is a significant and expanding role for technicians in the space industry, with a need for more in-house training and potential for increased popularity of technician registration.\"\n",

It highlights that technicians account for around 20% of the total workforce in space primes and specialist upstream manufacturers, while in organizations combining upstream manufacturing with downstream services, the share of technicians is much smaller, averaging under 5% of the total workforce. The study indicates that downstream firms and satellite operators accounted for fewer than 5% of the total number of technicians employed. The highly demanding and specialized nature of work in software, IT engineering services, and consultancy implies a preference for hiring individuals with at least a degree level qualification. Exceptions include a small number of vocationally educated IT technicians in database management and front-line helpdesk roles. The report suggests that the industry relies heavily on technicians in upstream manufacturing roles, and downstream firms and satellite operators employ a relatively small number of technicians. The need for technicians in the space sector is likely to remain focused on upstream manufacturing roles, with a small fraction employed in downstream organizations.

Larger organizations distinguish between apprenticeship schemes targeting level 4/5 qualifications and those targeting level 3 qualifications, with the former focusing more on electrical/electronic engineering. One components manufacturer has become involved in a Higher Apprenticeship scheme, aiming to fill roles requiring project leadership. There are variations in the annual intake of apprentices across organizations, with different entry requirements and acceptable completion rates. Upstream manufacturers are also planning to set up apprenticeship schemes, primarily to address the difficulty of recruiting experienced technicians with specific skills.

       "  'text': 'One prominent task carried out by some – though not, as we shall elaborate below, all – mechanical engineering technicians who work in the space industry is machining.Typically, this involves the technician carrying out both manual and CNC milling, turning and drilling in order to produce a variety of components and sub-assemblies for satellites, including: the aluminium and composite panels that constitute a satellite’s basic structure; various optical components used for the thermal control of spacecraft; and parts for the scientific instruments, detectors, and optical devices that make up the satellite’s payload. Much of this work must be carried out to very fine tolerances, in some cases requiring the technicians to view the part being machined under a microscope. In the case of CNC devices, the operators will typically work from 3-D CAD drawings provided either by technicians occupying the role of manufacturing or production engineer (see Section 4.2.1 [d] below) or by graduate-level engineers, but will programme, set and operate CNC machines themselves. Machinists may also be involved in making the mould tools, jigs and fixtures required for the manufacture and assembly of novel metal and composite parts.\\nTechnicians engaged in machining were found in nine of the 11 upstream organisations that employ mechanical engineering technicians.They are most numerous in the case of organisations that manufacture components and sub-assemblies for satellites but can also be found – in smaller numbers – in the space primes. In both the larger, specialist component manufacturers, and also in the space primes, machinists tend to have done some kind of manufacturing engineering apprenticeship at level 3. In the smaller organisations, especially those involved in the manufacture of bespoke instruments, machinists tend to be qualified to level 4 or even 5, having taken an HNC or even in some cases an HND. Perhaps this ought not to be too surprising, given that in the cases where novel instruments are being made, technicians may not only manufacture the instrument but may also have an input into its design, a task that demands a higher level of expertise than mass-producing standardised items (see Section 4.2.1 [d] below).\\nTwo of the larger organisations have dedicated roles for machinists, whose incumbents specialised in machining – as distinct from assembling and testing - components. In other cases, the task of machining parts was combined with other duties - such as those of fitting the components together to form larger sub-assemblies and/or testing the item that is thereby produced - to form a\\nsingle, multi-dimensional role.This brings us to the next kind of task carried out by workers with mechanical engineering skills, namely that of mechanical assembly.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Mechanical assembly involves technicians combining sets of mechanical components in order to form larger sub-assemblies or assemblies.Three examples will be given here, two drawn from organisations that make sub-assemblies for satellites, the third from a system integrator. In the case of the subassembly manufacturers, the technicians’ duties might, for instance, involve them welding together the pipework that forms part of a satellite’s propulsion system. Alternatively, they might work in a clean room and use certain components – which, depending on the division of labour within the organisation for which they work, they may or may not have fabricated themselves – to build a scientific instrument or detector that will form part of a satellite’s payload. Finally, to take an example drawn from one of the space primes, mechanical assembly technicians are charged with the task of positioning the satellite’s carbon fibre core and aluminium structural panels in jigs and then fastening them to one another in order in order to construct the satellite’s basic skeleton. Other key mechanical components - such as the satellite’s main engine, subsidiary thrusters, insulation and thermal control systems, and fuel tanks and associated pipework - will then be attached to the basic structure to form a larger assembly known as the service module.The service module will ultimately be connected to the second major part of the satellite, namely the communications module, in order to complete the main body of the satellite. More will be said about the role of technicians in making the communications module in Section 4.2.2 (b) below. In all of these cases, the manufacturing technicians who fabricate items will also be involved in testing them (by checking that the flight bolts that hold the main parts of a satellite’s structure together have been tightened to the right torque, for example, or by testing to ensure that the satellite’s propulsion system works properly).\\nAll told, 11 of the case study organisations have technicians engaged in various forms of mechanical assembly. Of these, three organisations have specialist mechanical assembly technicians. In the other eight organisations, the task of assembling the mechanical components is combined with that of manufacturing the components, or of testing the final assembly, so that the technician roles are multi-faceted. As was the case with the machinists described above, in larger organisations where there are dedicated assembly technicians, they tend to be qualified to level 3. In the smaller organisations, and once again especially in those involved in the precision manufacture of scientific instruments and detectors, there is a more of a tendency for people engaged in mechanical assembly to have an HNC or HND and therefore to be qualified to level 4/5.6\\nAside from the formal qualifications just noted, it is important to note another important skill that many mechanical – and, as we shall see, electrical and electronics – assembly technicians are required to possess, namely that of adhering to very high standards of cleanliness.The contamination of mechanical and electrical/electronic space hardware by dirt, dust or even fingerprints can severely and adversely affect its performance once it is in space. Accordingly,\\ntechnicians need to be aware both of the procedures for working in temperature- and humidity-controlled clean rooms (e.g. how to use the special gowns and gloves that must be worn, what materials and equipment can and cannot be brought into the clean room, etc.) and also of the methods used for the precision-cleaning of parts so as to avoid contamination that might jeopardise the reliability of a sub-assembly or assembly (e.g. the use of vacuum ovens for the dry heat sterilisation of parts).'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Another role often occupied by technicians with level 4/5 vocational qualifications is variously described as that of a production engineer, manufacturing engineer or draughtsman. One of the duties associated with such roles is that of writing the work instructions that specify the procedures that machinists and mechanical assembly technicians should follow in order to manufacture a particular part or assembly. For example, if a mechanical fitter is assembling parts of a satellite, it will be the manufacturing engineer who, in the course of drafting the work instructions, specifies the torque that has to be applied to the flight bolts that are used to connect the various modules. In addition to drafting work instructions, manufacturing engineers will typically oversee the day-to-day activities of the workers who are actually manufacturing items, responding to queries and dealing with relatively straightforward problems.They are also usually charged with the task of continually reviewing and improving the manufacturing process. Finally, they will normally also prepare the quality assurance paperwork that is used to document the operations carried out on each item during the stage(s) of the production process for which they are responsible.\\nIn addition to overseeing and guiding the production workers in their team, manufacturing engineers also advise the chartered engineers in their organisation about the ease with which the components and modules can actually be built. Manufacturing engineers’ experience of the difficulties that can arise in implementing certain designs enables them to provide advice and feedback to ostensibly better qualified, but in certain key respects often less knowledgeable, chartered engineers about how to design components, sub-assemblies and assemblies in ways that will make them (relatively) easy to build.The institutional manifestation of the need to have people who are experienced in the practical side of manufacturing involved in the design process is to be found in the existence of manufacturing engineers who work in the design office rather than on the shop floor. Situated thus, manufacturing engineers can bring their practical expertise in the practical side of manufacturing to bear on the design of hardware.This is likely to involve them using 3-D CAD packages to help design components: while the chartered design engineers might produce the broad schematic overview of a particular component, specifying for example the broad\\nperformance requirements it has to satisfy, it is the manufacturing engineers who turn those general schematic ideas into detailed designs of individual parts.To use a phrase employed by one interviewee, the manufacturing engineer will take over once the chartered engineer ‘has done the sums’. In addition to designing individual components, manufacturing engineers may also be involved in helping to design the jigs and fixtures that are used to hold parts in place in the course of producing and testing components and assemblies.\\nA closely related role that is usually occupied by people with good vocational qualifications is that of a drawing office technician or draughtsman. Like manufacturing engineers, people occupying such roles will assist technicians, for example by drafting drawings and instructions that specify for machinists the dimensions of the parts they are meant to be fabricating or that set out for the benefit of assembly technicians such key issues as: the order in which various mechanical, electrical and electronic components, assemblies and sub-assemblies should be mounted on the satellite structure; where those parts are to be placed; and how they are to be attached (e.g. what length of bolt should be used). As one source put it, ‘The draughtsman’s task is to turn the engineer’s schematic ideas into the detailed plans used … to build the hardware.’ As was true for the manufacturing engineers who occupy design-related roles, so it is also true of draughtsmen that while they operate within the broad parameters specified by chartered engineers, they exercise discretion and bring their own expertise to bear in deciding how precisely the engineer’s broad schematic designs are to be realised. As one interviewee put it, far from simply passing on information provided to them by the graduate-level designers about where exactly to locate particular modules, or in precisely what order to mount them on the satellite, ‘the drawing office technicians have to generate this kind of information themselves.’\\n8 organisations in the sample visited for this project have roles that closely resemble those of the manufacturing engineer and draughtsman just described, though the precise term used to describe the role may vary between organisations.The occupants of such roles tend to be qualified to at least level 4/5, possessing HNCs, HNDs and – in the case of some people who have only recently come into post - Foundation degrees (in mechanical engineering).This is also a case where there is sometimes a blurring of the boundaries between technician-level roles and graduate-level roles; manufacturing engineering roles may be occupied either by technicians of the kind just described or by more practically-oriented graduates.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'One common role, found in nine of the upstream organisations visited for this project, is that of the PCB (electronics) assembly technician.The workers who occupy this role – who are found both in both components and sub-system suppliers as well as in the space primes - help to make the electronic devices that constitute much of a satellite’s communications module or payload.This involves them: populating printed circuit boards (PCBs) with components, either by hand or using automatic ‘pick and place’ machines; and then carrying out the micro-soldering, and epoxy- and wire-bonding required both to hold the components in place and also to connect the completed boards to each other and to integrated circuits so as to form larger electronic modules and devices. In addition to the specific techniques required for this kind of PCB layout or surface mount assembly, as it is known, electronics assembly technicians must also adhere to the protocols for working in clean rooms, displaying an understanding both of how to prevent electrostatic discharges that might damage electronic components/ assemblies and also of how to avoid contaminating parts with dirt and dust that might hamper their reliable operation once in orbit.\\nThe technicians who fabricate these electronic devices often also inspect and test them, using various kinds of non-destructive testing – such as using microscopes and X-rays to check for defects in the solder – in order to ensure that the quality of their workmanship meets the rigorous standards required of flightworthy components. We shall return to the issues of testing below, when we discuss the specialist test technicians who work in many upstream space companies (see Section 4.2.3).\\nThe workers who fill these roles are typically apprentice-trained in electronics, sometimes to level three but often – and especially in smaller organisations – to level 4 (HNC). In addition, all nine of the organisations ensure that the skills of their electronics assembly technicians are ESA-certificated. ESA certification involves the technician attending training courses of 3-5 days in length, usually at an approved training centre, during which they will receive training in various aspects of electronics assembly for the space industry, including high-reliability soldering and the repair, modification and inspection of PCBs.The training is designed to ensure that the electronics technicians consistently achieve the very high standards of work required to manufacture electronic devices that are reliable enough to be used in satellites.Technicians must be retrained every two years to retain their status as certified ESA operators. While ESA-certification is not obligatory, save for work that is funded by the European Space Agency, it provides an important signal to other potential customers that an organisation has a skilled workforce and therefore helps firms to win contracts for space-related work. What this illustrates, of course, is one – in this case, relatively formal - way in which the extremely high quality products demanded by space firms drive training in the sector.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'While PCB assembly is perhaps the most common kind of electronics and electrical assembly work found in the space sector, technicians may also specialise in combining electronic and/or electrical components to form other kinds of sub-assembly and assembly. For example, in the case of some of the firms that supply sub-systems to space primes, technicians skilled in electronics and electrical work are involved in the assembly - and, where relevant, calibration - of detectors, scientific instruments, RF signalling and test equipment, batteries, and power and propulsion sub-systems. In the case of one space prime, integration technicians who are skilled in electrical and electronic engineering will mount onto the satellite’s structural panels various electrical and electronics devices - including wiring and cable harnesses, the transponders that enable the satellite to receive, amplify, process, and transmit radio signals to and from earth, along with the scientific instruments, detectors and sensors that constitute the rest of the satellite’s payload - in order to form the so-called communications-module.The communications module is the part of the satellite that - by providing a means of communication, or of broadcasting television pictures, or of taking images of the earth - actually delivers the services required by the organisation for which it is being built.The communications modules will ultimately be ‘mated’ with, or joined to, the service module in order to complete the main body of the satellite. Technicians may also be involved in the assembly of electrical and electronic communications, monitoring and testing equipment for satellite ground stations. The same technicians are often also involved in testing the electrical systems (e.g., batteries, electrical connections, etc.) and the electronic components and devices (e.g. the RF signalling equipment that enables the satellite to transmit signals to and from earth, scientific instruments and detectors) to ensure that they work properly.\\nTechnicians carrying out work of this kind – sometimes as specialists, sometimes as part of a role that includes other duties – were found in 11 of the organisations visited for this study.The modal qualification was an HNC in electrical and/or electronics engineering, though a minority the occupants of this kind of role were formally qualified only to level 3, while a (slightly larger) minority had HNDs. Many of these technicians are also ESA-certified in soldering, crimping and wiring, so that both their employer and potential clients can be assured that their workmanship meets the high standards required of space-qualified hardware. Once again, a good deal of this work takes place under clean room conditions, and technicians must be conversant with the rules that govern work in such an environment as well as with the equipment – such as aqueous batch cleaners and ultrasonic baths - that is used to clean electronic components and devices.\\n4.2.2 (c) Electrical/Electronics Engineer/Draughtsman/Component Engineer As was the case with the more experienced mechanical engineers, so it is also true of electrical and electronics engineers that more experienced and better qualified workers are often found in roles that involve them contributing to the design of electronic and electrical assemblies and sub-assemblies. Workers of this kind occupy roles that are given various titles, including electrical and electronics engineer, parts and materials engineer, and draughtsman. Analogously to production or manufacturing engineers, electrical and electronics engineers may well draft work instructions that specify for less qualified workers how a particular electronic or electrical device should be made. For instance, an electronics engineer may specify the amount of heat and pressure that a PCB assembly worker needs to apply in order to fabricate a particular kind of electronic device. Electrical and electronics engineers will typically be responsible for the day-to-day activities of the workers who form part of their team and also for preparing the documentation required as part of the stringent quality assurance procedures used in space manufacturing.Their responsibilities typically also include dealing with routine problems and identifying potential improvements to the manufacturing process.\\nTechnicians skilled in electrical and electronics engineering may also have a role to play in the design of assemblies and sub-assemblies, augmenting the important contribution made by chartered design engineers. For instance, to use examples drawn from four component suppliers and sub-assembly manufacturers visited for this study, technician-level workers occupying roles with titles such as Parts and Materials Engineer, Component Engineer or PCB Designer take the general performance specifications provided by graduate-level design engineers and flesh them out by adding the details required to produce a complete design of the electronic device in question.There may be several aspects to this. In the first place, as one source put it, ‘[A]fter receiving guidelines and schematic input from the [chartered] engineer, I have to complete the creation of PCBs … [by finalising the relevant] drawings.’  Second, the technician will also typically identify and procure the individual components, choosing them so that, once appropriately assembled, they will constitute a device that has the required properties.To take another example, drawn this time from a space prime, vocationally-educated draughtsmen will produce engineering drawings that specify for the benefit of assembly and integration technicians where various electronics components and devices – such as waveguides and wiring harnesses – should be fitted to a satellite’s structural panels.Third, higher-level technicians participate in design reviews and provide feedback to design engineers on the ease with which the item can be manufactured, thereby – as one interviewee put it – contributing to ‘design for manufacture and test’. In all these ways, in the words of two other interviewees, technicians ‘take an idea developed by a designer … and translate it into reality’, thereby ‘bridg[ing] the gap between design and manufacture.’7\\nHigher-level technician roles of this kind were found in eight of the case study organisations.The occupants of such roles are almost invariably educated to at least HNC or HND level.These roles may also on occasions be occupied by more practically inclined graduates.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'One of the most distinctive features of the space industry is the extremely rigorous regime of testing to which all space hardware is subjected. Components, sub-systems and assemblies all undergo a variety of tests designed to ensure, with a very high probability, that they will perform reliably in face of the extreme conditions they will experience both during launch and also once they are in orbit. Components will typically be tested before they are integrated to form a sub-assembly or assembly, tested again once they are part of that sub-assembly, and then tested once more after the sub-assembly or assembly has been installed onto the satellite. Since satellites cannot be tested in flight, the process of qualifying a component or sub-assembly as being of flight standard requires that it be tested in ways that simulate the extreme conditions of the launch and orbital environment as realistically as possible. Such tests include: mechanical vibration, acoustic and shock tests, which are designed to ensure that the components, sub-assemblies and assemblies can withstand the vibrations and shock waves that they will experience during launch and in the course of deployment into orbit; thermal vacuum tests, which simulate the extreme variation in temperatures, from +120°C to -170°C, that the hardware will undergo in space; and radiation tests, which are intended to ensure that hardware will continue to function in the face of the intense solar radiation to which it will be exposed whilst in orbit.Test results must be formally documented using established protocols.'},\n",

Similarly to the case of manufacturing/production engineers and electrical/ electronics engineers, these roles may also be filled by degree-qualified people.'}]"

      "Having discussed the origins of the case study organisations’ current technicians, we move on now to consider how the organisations in question propose to satisfy their future need for technicians.That is to say, we shall consider in this section the workforce planning strategies adopted by those space companies that employ technicians.This is an interesting and important issue, for a number of reasons.The first is that, as noted above, the increasingly difficulty of recruiting experienced technicians means that the approach most commonly adopted hitherto, namely recruitment-plus-upgrading, may not be as sustainable in the future as it was in the past. Second, many of the case study organisations, including seven of the 12 who are either currently training apprentices or are planning to do so – are growing, often very rapidly, and require increasing numbers of technicians. Of course, this reflects the more general point – made above – that the space industry is growing rapidly, both in terms of the value of its business and also in terms of total employment. It is also worth noting in this context a point made by three firms in particular, namely that as these firms grow the number of technicians may rise as a share of their total employment.The reason is as follows.The firms in question are currently rather small, both in terms of the volume of business they have and also in terms of total employment.Their small size is significant, because it means that in the past they had little or no scope to employ specialist technicians, simply because they have not had enough technician-type work to warrant employing a specialist of that kind. (Typically, the technician-type work has instead been done by graduates.11)  However, as the volume of business undertaken by the firms expands, there arises a point at which it becomes worthwhile for the firms in question to employ specialist technicians in some parts of their business.There is some reason to think, therefore, that as at least some space companies move from very small-scale batch manufacturing of bespoke commercial satellites to building (somewhat) more standardised products, the number of specialist technicians employed will grow as a share of the manufacturing workforce.\n",
