We will articulate and, where possible, forecast skills gaps in critical technologies (within academia, industry, government and the third sector) and actions needed to fill them.\n",
      "● Recruited and retained high-quality FE and school teachers in STEM-related subjects.\n",
      "● Expanded opportunities for participation in STEM and ensured that a more diverse range of people enter the science and technology workforce. We will learn from examples like AI and data science conversion courses, where we have invested up to £30 million to help people from underrepresented groups join the UK’s AI industry.\n",
      "● Established competitive advantage in attracting international talent to the UK. The UK’s offer will be attractive to the world's best talent across all career stages, with easy access through our ‘high-skilled visa system’ (Global Talent, Start Up/Innovator, High Potential Individual, Scale Up and Graduate). UK researchers will participate in exchanges which deliver international links and establish new collaborations.\n",
      "● Given people the opportunity to train, retrain and upskill throughout their lives to respond to changing needs. We will create proactive career advice programmes which establish links between STEM training or education at 16 and well-paid jobs. This includes revolutionary initiatives like the Lifelong Loan Entitlement, especially important given 80% of the 2030 workforce is already in work.\n",
      "The Department for Education is working on a cross-government action plan in collaboration with the Home Office, Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, Department for Business and Trade and the Cabinet Office. Initial work will include:\n",

      "• Sustainable environment • Health and life sciences • Digital economy • National security and defence • International comparison • Foundational • Market potential • Threats and resilience\n",

      "Artificial intelligence (AI) – Machines that perform tasks normally performed by human intelligence, especially when the machines learn from data how to do those tasks.\n",
      "Engineering biology – the application of rigorous engineering principles to the design of biological systems.\n",
      "Future telecommunications - evolutions of the infrastructure for digitised data and communications.\n",
      "Semiconductors – a class of electronic materials with unique properties that sit at the heart of the devices and technology we use every day.\n",

      "The National Science and Technology Council will review this list annually to ensure that the UK keeps pace and continues to develop global competitive advantage - although there will be a high bar to major change given the need for long-term planning.\n",
      "● Create the environment for these technologies to flourish in the UK, using the other nine levers set out in this Framework. Where necessary, the government must\n",
      "be prepared to intervene to shape markets. We will develop a cross-government plan to optimise the science and technology system for each critical technology. Plans will be informed by analysis of the UK’s strategic interests and strengths, and other nations’ postures, using an ‘Own-Collaborate-Access’ framework as a guide. We will consider where reliable and resilient supply chains are needed, with established methods for securing goods, to enable companies to grow and protect the UK from supply shocks.\n",
      "The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology is working on a cross-government action plan for each of the critical technologies. Initial work will include:\n",
      "● Developing a pro-innovation approach to regulating AI, which will be detailed in a White Paper to be published in early 2023.\n",
      "● Publishing UK strategies for semiconductors and quantum technologies in early 2023.\n",
      "● Publishing ambitious Wireless Infrastructure Strategy, which sets out our R&D priorities for future telecoms including 6G\n",
      "● Establishing a strategic approach to Engineering Biology and its applications across the economy, by mid 2023, to maximise opportunities and mitigate the risks.\n",
      "● For each critical technology, establishing a plan to protect the strategic advantage that we develop from state threats.\n",
      "● Ensuring that emerging technologies such as Large Language Models can be used to support a more innovative public sector while managing the risks.\n",
      "Note: “identifying critical technologies” is a unique strand of this Science and Technology\n",

Some organizations have had their apprenticeship schemes accredited by professional bodies, while others cite a lack of awareness or interest among their technicians as reasons for not pursuing accreditation. The Technician Council is identified as having considerable work to do in raising the profile of technician registration in the space industry. The section emphasizes the need for ongoing training and professional development for technicians and highlights the importance of raising awareness and interest in technician registration.\"\n",

      "  \"summary\": \"The section discusses the roles, qualifications, acquisition, and ongoing training of technicians in the UK space industry. It highlights the majority of technicians being employed in the upstream sector, with qualifications typically at level 4. The common route for acquiring technicians involves vocational education, work experience, and upgrade training. However, there is a shift towards more upstream space manufacturers taking on apprentices. The evidence suggests a growing imbalance between supply and demand for technicians, leading to an increasing reliance on apprenticeship programs. The report also emphasizes the need for sufficient training and apprenticeship schemes to meet the industry's demand for technicians. Employers are encouraged to invest in the career development of technicians, but there is little use of technician registration. Overall, there is a significant and expanding role for technicians in the space industry, with a need for more in-house training via apprenticeship programs to address the growing imbalances in the technician labor market.\"\n",

It highlights the use of apprenticeships for workforce planning, addressing future skills needs resulting from expansion or anticipated retirement of skilled workers. The text also emphasizes the advantage of apprenticeship training in socializing young people into the organization's culture and desired work standards. Additionally, it mentions the need for more training and apprenticeships to fill jobs arising from planned growth in manufacturing and services, as indicated in a recent report on the space sector. The section does not explicitly mention advanced computing, battery technologies, semiconductors, or clean energy. There is no discussion of funding, investments, or budget allocations. The future need for specialist technician skills is implied, and the text emphasizes the value of starting with individuals who have no preconceptions and can be molded to desired work habits.

       "         'summary': \"The section discusses the organisation of apprenticeship training programmes in eight organisations, seven downstream and one upstream, under the government's Advanced Apprenticeship programme. The apprentices are recruited and trained by external training providers, with funding from the Skills Funding Agency. The training aims to equip apprentices with advanced manufacturing techniques needed for the space industry, focusing on qualifications in mechanical, electrical, and electronics engineering. Some apprenticeship schemes are approved by professional bodies, leading to EngTech awards. Larger organisations aim for apprentices to progress beyond level 3 qualifications, targeting HNC or Foundation Degree qualifications. There is a distinction between apprenticeship schemes targeting level 3 qualifications for shop floor manufacturing roles and those aiming for level 4/5 qualifications for production/manufacturing engineering positions. One employer has become involved in a Higher Apprenticeship scheme, while others are considering it. The annual intake of apprentices varies across organisations, with different entry requirements, but generally acceptable applicant quantity and quality. Completion rates are uniformly high. Upstream manufacturers are planning to set up apprenticeship schemes to address the difficulty of recruiting technicians with specific skills. They specialize in supplying electronics/electrical components and sub-assemblies to the space industry, with a focus on electronics engineering and, in some cases, elements of electrical and mechanical engineering. The organisations anticipate devolving much of the responsibility for organising the apprenticeship to a specialist training provider.\"},\n",

It highlights difficulties with FE colleges, including issues with technical certificates, inadequate support from assessors, and concerns about the quality of practical training. Some organizations in rural areas struggle to find colleges offering relevant courses due to funding constraints and low student numbers. Despite concerns about apprentices leaving after training, employers value apprenticeship programs as a way to signal value to young employees and promote loyalty.

      "Having discussed the origins of the case study organisations’ current technicians, we move on now to consider how the organisations in question propose to satisfy their future need for technicians.That is to say, we shall consider in this section the workforce planning strategies adopted by those space companies that employ technicians.This is an interesting and important issue, for a number of reasons.The first is that, as noted above, the increasingly difficulty of recruiting experienced technicians means that the approach most commonly adopted hitherto, namely recruitment-plus-upgrading, may not be as sustainable in the future as it was in the past. Second, many of the case study organisations, including seven of the 12 who are either currently training apprentices or are planning to do so – are growing, often very rapidly, and require increasing numbers of technicians. Of course, this reflects the more general point – made above – that the space industry is growing rapidly, both in terms of the value of its business and also in terms of total employment. It is also worth noting in this context a point made by three firms in particular, namely that as these firms grow the number of technicians may rise as a share of their total employment.The reason is as follows.The firms in question are currently rather small, both in terms of the volume of business they have and also in terms of total employment.Their small size is significant, because it means that in the past they had little or no scope to employ specialist technicians, simply because they have not had enough technician-type work to warrant employing a specialist of that kind. (Typically, the technician-type work has instead been done by graduates.11)  However, as the volume of business undertaken by the firms expands, there arises a point at which it becomes worthwhile for the firms in question to employ specialist technicians in some parts of their business.There is some reason to think, therefore, that as at least some space companies move from very small-scale batch manufacturing of bespoke commercial satellites to building (somewhat) more standardised products, the number of specialist technicians employed will grow as a share of the manufacturing workforce.\n",
