      "Recent policy statements issued by the Coalition government have emphasised the importance of increasing both the status and also the numbers of technicians in the UK economy.Technicians may be defined as ‘highly productive people who apply proven techniques and procedures to the solution of practical problems.They carry supervisory or technical responsibility and competently deliver their skills and creativity in the fields of science, engineering and technology’ (Technician Council 2012). Current practice in UK policy-making circles is for the term ‘technician’ to be used to describe people occupying technical roles that require level 3 skills (e.g. advanced apprenticeship), and which are therefore categorised as ‘skilled trades’, as well as those whose job requires them to have level 4/5 skills and who therefore fall into the category of ‘associate professional/technical’ workers (e.g. HNC/HND, Foundation degree) (BIS 2010a: 7; Jagger et al., 2010;Technician Council 2011, 2012).\n",
      "The goal of policy, stated in two recent White Papers, is to create a ‘modern class of technicians’ (BIS 2009: 18, 2010a: 7, 18).The background against which this goal has been adopted is one in which there is increasing concern about skills shortages at the technician level (UKCES 2010a, 2010b; HM Treasury and Department of Business, Innovation and Skills 2011: 85; Spilsbury and Garrett 2011). Accordingly, ambitious targets have been set for increasing the number of apprentice technicians (BIS 2010a: 7, 15; HM Treasury and Department of Business, Innovation and Skills 2010: 18-19; House of Commons Library 2011: 4-6). In addition, a Technician Council has been established in an attempt to ensure that the significant contribution made by technicians to the organisations in which they work, and thereby to society at large, is more widely recognised than hitherto, to increase the opportunities for career development open to technicians, and to increase the number of technicians being trained in the UK (BIS 2009, 2010a: 18; HM Treasury and Department of Business, Innovation and Skills 2011: 89; Technician Council 2011, 2012: 2, 5).\n",
      "The policy goals of increased technician numbers and enhanced status will be achieved only if the nature of technician work, and the demand for and supply of technician skills, are well understood. It is towards the goal of achieving such an understanding that the current paper aims to contribute. It does so by exploring the duties, skills, and training, of one important, but hitherto largely unstudied, group of technicians, namely those who work in the UK Space Sector.The space industry, along with the aerospace sector of which it forms a part, is viewed by policy-makers as one of the key advanced manufacturing sectors upon which the future of UK manufacturing hinges. As a rapidly growing, advanced manufacturing industry, space is naturally of interest to policy-makers who – like the current government – are seeking to increase the number of apprentices in training (BIS 2010b, 2010c; SEMTA 2009: 11-18).This is because, in the words of a recent report on technicians, ‘the level and type of skills that technicians have are vital to emerging markets in the UK, such as [the] advanced manufacturing and engineering industries. Becoming more production and export-led means becoming more technician led’ (Skills Commission 2011: 16). In keeping with such remarks, a recent report outlining an overall growth strategy for the space industry, penned by a group representing both the commercial and academic arms of the space sector as well as government, specified a target of doubling the number of apprentices in the space industry by January 2015\n",
      "(albeit without specifying how many apprentices are currently being trained by space firms) (Space IGS 2010a: 45).\n",
      "The goal of the research project described in this paper is to inform policy by shedding light on the use, and acquisition by employers, of technicians in the space industry. More specifically, the paper focuses on five sets of questions. First, in what roles are technicians employed in the UK space industry and what are their principal duties? Second, what qualifications do those technicians typically possess? Third, to the extent that they need technicians, how do organisations in the space industry acquire them? In particular, what balance do employers strike between recruitment and (different forms of) training in satisfying their need for suitably skilled technicians? Fourth, are there skills shortages at the technician level in the space industry? And, if there are, is government policy helping to alleviate them? Fifth, and finally, what provision do employers make for the ongoing training and career development of their technicians?\n",
      "The structure of the report is as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of UK Space industry, in order to provide background information and context for the ensuing discussion of technician duties, skills and training. Section 3 briefly outlines the research methodology adopted in this study. Section 4 begins the presentation of the study’s findings, focusing in particular on the types of space firms that employ technicians, the kind of roles those technicians fill, their qualifications, and the route through which they came to be employed in the space industry. Section 5 continues with the presentation of the results, focusing in particular on the way in which the current state of the technician labour market is affecting employers’ decisions about the appropriate balance to strike between recruitment and, in particular, apprenticeship training.This section also considers the ongoing training provided for established technicians. Section 6 summarises the discussion.\n",

      "Source Text:\n",
      "1. The Coalition government has set itself the goal of creating ‘a modern class of technicians.’Technicians are highly productive people who apply proven techniques and procedures to the solution of practical problems.They carry supervisory or technical responsibility and competently deliver their skills and creativity in the fields of science, engineering and technology.There are currently concerns both about skills shortages at the technician level and also about the age of the technician workforce.The government is attempting to address these concerns by adopting policies that are intended to increase both the status and also the numbers of technicians in the UK economy.\n",
      "2. This report investigates the role of technicians in an important part of the advanced manufacturing sector of the UK economy, namely the space industry. The space sector is comprised of all the public and private sector actors involved in the producing of goods and services via the exploration, understanding and utilisation of space. It has two main parts: the ‘upstream’ consists of organisations that manufacture (parts of) satellites; the downstream companies use satellites to provide telecommunications and broadcasting, weather-forecasting, and location and navigational services. In 2008-09, the space sector had a turnover of about £7.5 billion, adding £3.6 billion of value to UK GDP and directly employing around 25,000 people. It accounts for a little under 10% of the global space economy. Labour productivity in the sector is about 2¾ times greater than the average for UK manufacturing and 3½ times the average for the economy as a whole.The sector grew at around 9-10% per annum in real terms throughout the first decade of the twenty-first century.\n",
      "3. The aim of the project on which this report is based was to inform government policy towards technicians by investigating their duties, the skills they are required to have, and how employers obtain them, in the space sector.The project forms part of a wider programme of research into technician duties, skills and training in various strategically important sectors of the economy, including – in addition to space – the aerospace, composites, chemicals, and nuclear sectors.\n",
      "4. More specifically, the research reported here focused on five sets of questions.\n",
      "•\n",
      "In what roles are technicians employed in the UK space industry and what are their principal duties?\n",
      "•\n",
      "What qualifications do those technicians typically possess?\n",
      "•\n",
      "How do organisations in the space sector acquire the technicians they need?\n",
      "•\n",
      "Are there skills shortages at the technician level in the space industry?\n",
      "•\n",
      "What provision do employers make for the ongoing training and career development of their technicians?\n",
      "5. Data was collected via interviews with 15 sector-level organisations, including government departments, learned societies, and trade bodies, and through case studies of 25 space sector employers (12 upstream, eight downstream, and five involved in both upstream and downstream activities).The case study organisations included component and sub-system manufacturers, space primes, satellite operators, IT and software engineering companies, and downstream service providers. Case studies included both public- and private-sector organisations.\n",
      "6. The data indicate that the vast majority of the technicians who work in the sector are employed by upstream manufacturers, where they account for around 20% of the total workforce. Few – in many cases, no - technicians are employed by satellite operators, by the organisations that specialise provide software and engineering support for the space industry, and by downstream service providers. The reason is that, given the technical demands of the work carried out in such organisations, technical roles must be filled by people who are qualified at least to degree level.\n",
      "7. The roles filled by the technicians who work in organisations involved in upstream manufacturing activities include the following: machinist; mechanical assembly technician; production/manufacturing engineer; electronics assembly and integration technician; electronic/component engineer; test technician; and test engineer.The most common qualification possessed by technicians is an HNC in some form of engineering.\n",
      "8. Only a minority of the upstream manufacturers and space primes that employ technicians have had apprenticeship schemes in place long enough for them to make a significant contribution to their technician workforce. Until very recently, most of the organisations involved in upstream manufacturing obtained their technicians in one of two main ways: either by hiring people who already work in the space industry from the external labour market; or by recruiting people who have done an apprenticeship and worked for some time in a different industry and then providing them with the extra training – concerning the exacting tolerances to which work must be completed and the quality assurance procedures that must be followed – that they need to be able to work in space manufacturing (‘upgrade training’).\n",
      "9. However, there is evidence that organisations involved in manufacturing for the space sector are beginning to move away from this reliance on a combination of recruitment and upgrade training towards a greater use of in-house training and, in particular, apprenticeships, as a means of satisfying their need for technicians. Several such organisations have either recently set up an apprenticeship scheme or are in the process of doing so.The reasons for this are twofold. First, it is becoming increasingly difficult to recruit experienced technicians – whether they be ‘space ready’ or technicians from other industries who can be ‘upgraded’ for work in the space industry – from the external labour market. Second, in keeping with the rapid growth of the space sector as a whole, many firms are growing and therefore increasing the size of their workforce in general and their technician workforce in particular (the latter point reflecting the fact that – as the firms in question expand and adopt a more elaborate division of labour – there is more scope for specialist technician roles to be used).\n",
      "10.\n",
      "Apprenticeship training is also said to bring three other advantages. First, it helps organisations in their efforts to plan for the orderly succession of an ageing technician workforce. Second, it affords employers an opportunity to take young people and socialise them into the relevant organisational culture, so that they acquire the values and habits – concerning the exceptionally high standards of work required, and the importance of adhering rigidly to the relevant procedures – insisted upon by space manufacturers.Third, the provision of apprentice training can signal to young people that they are valued by their employer, who will support them and give them the opportunity to develop their career within that organisation, thereby helping to build apprentices’ loyalty and commitment to the employer that initially trained them.\n",
      "11.\n",
      "Apprentices are typically studying for qualifications in mechanical and electronic/ electrical engineering, with a view to achieving an HNC or (less commonly) an HND by the end of their apprenticeship.Apprentice numbers tend to be relatively small, reflecting the small size of most employers in the space sector. Only three organisations recruit more than 10 apprentices per annum (and, in one of those cases, some of the apprentices are likely to be destined for the organisation’s non-space related business). In the case of the other organisations that take apprentices, or are considering doing so, the employers in question are typically looking to recruit just one or two apprentices per year at present.\n",
      "12.\n",
      "Employers face a number of impediments to their efforts to establish apprenticeship training programmes. Some have had difficulty finding a further education college that is willing to offer the kind of off-the-job training they want their apprentices to have (in particular, HNCs in electronics). Several have been disappointed by the quality of the support provided by FE colleges once their training schemes have been set up.\n",
      "13.\n",
      "So far as ongoing training for more established technicians is concerned, most of the organisations that employ technicians are willing to support them to do part-time Foundation Degrees or full honours degrees, usually in physics or engineering.Those electrical and electronics assembly technicians who are certified by the European Space Agency must re-trained every two years if they are to retain their status. Uncertificated ongoing training in technical matters is also often provided either in-house by more experienced staff or delivered externally by equipment suppliers, and is an important source of skills development. Only a small minority of organisations currently support their technicians for professional registration (i.e., EngTech).\n",
      "14.\n",
      "In view of the fact that more and more organisations in the upstream, manufacturing part of the space sector are looking towards apprenticeship training, but are finding it difficult to discover high-quality provision, it would be worthwhile for policy-makers to explore (i) whether the incentives currently confronting further education colleges provide sufficient encouragement for them to offer off-the-job training (‘technical certificates’) of the kind needed by space manufacturers, and (ii) whether there is a way for the smaller organisations that wish to take apprentices to ‘piggy back’ on the established apprentice training schemes already being offered by one or two of the larger space organisations.\n",

      "Yes, the report mentions the skills and qualifications possessed by technicians in the space industry. It discusses the types of qualifications that technicians typically possess, such as HNCs in engineering, and the ongoing training provided for established technicians. Additionally, it highlights the skills shortages at the technician level in the space industry and the need for apprenticeship training to address these shortages. However, it does not delve into specific technologies used by technicians in the space industry.\n",

      "Neither those organisations that are currently take apprentices, nor the ones thinking of doing so, have found in the process of running on apprenticeship to be entirely straightforward. Finding an FE college to provide the off-the-job training, and in many cases also the assessment for the on-the-job element of the apprenticeship, has been a particular source of difficulty, both for those organisations that currently take apprentices and also for those intending to do so. More specifically, four of the eight space sector organisations that currently take apprentices highlighted problems in their relations with FE colleges, including apprentices being put on the wrong technical certificates, inadequate support and feedback being provided by external NVQ assessors, and concerns about the quality of the practical, hand-skills training being provided in college workshops for apprentices spending their first year on block release. While, as noted above, all the organisations taking apprentices had delegated formal responsibility for organising the training to an external provider, it is clear from interviews that employers still have to work hard to ensure that the colleges deliver the quality of support required for the apprenticeship programme to be a success.21\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, of the five organisations that are currently in the process of setting up a scheme, two – both situated in relatively rural areas - are having difficulties in finding a college willing to offer courses of the kind the employer want their apprentices to take (namely, HNCs in electronics). As one employer put it, ‘The colleges aren’t geared up for what I want … They haven’t got the departments [to teach it].’The main problem in these cases was that there were insufficient numbers of students wanting to take the courses in question to make it worthwhile, given the prevailing funding regime, for colleges to offer them. As one of the frustrated employers summarised the problem, ‘College funding is contingent on student numbers and it’s easier to get them via hairdressing, customer service, etc., than via engineering.’22 Indeed, one of the space organisations that is not taking apprentices said that this was partly because of difficulties in finding the right college course and also because of poor experiences with an FE college when they had taken a customer service apprentice in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is interesting to note, however, that one potentially significant deterrent to the use of apprenticeships, namely the possibility that once they have completed their training apprentices will leave the organisation that has sponsored them, thereby depriving their employer of the opportunity to recoup its investment in them, appears not to be a problem in practice. While those employers that offer, or are considering offering, apprenticeships are clearly conscious of the possibility that their newly qualified apprentices will be poached, in no case were concerns sufficient to deter them from training young people. (Poaching did not feature at all in the reasons given by those organisations that were not interested in apprenticeships for their decision not to train young people.) The most common reason for this, mentioned by six of the employers interviewed for this study, centred on the belief that, if coupled with the possibility of promotion,\n",
      "\n",
      "the provision of providing apprentice training can signal to young people that they are valued by their employer and that they will have the chance to develop their career within their current organisation, rather than having to move elsewhere to do so, thereby helping to build loyalty and commitment to the employer that initially trained them.23 Perhaps most notably, one large employer – which has taken apprentices for over 15 years – pointed out that over 80% of the apprentices that have been trained over that period remain with the organisation, primarily because they can see that there are well-defined career paths from an apprenticeship to senior roles.The point, then, which appears to have been taken on board by most if not all of the organisations in the sample considered here that are (considering becoming) involved in apprenticeship training, is that if apprenticeships are complemented by other HR practices concerning continued training and career progression, they can help to persuade apprentices that their future lies with their current employer rather than elsewhere, thereby building loyalty, reducing turnover and helping firms to ensure that they earn a positive return on their investment in training.24\n",
