They have developed very clear and user-friendly ‘professional’ apprenticeship standards for key roles in the sector, such as chefs and front-of-house staff. These include the key functions of the job and the behaviours required to succeed in the role. This focus on behaviours is crucial given the importance of customer service to the industry. \n",

For example, a creative and design route, a digital route, engineering and manufacture, health and science, catering and hospitality, construction, business and administrative and so on. These would sit alongside and be comparable with the academic route from school to university with bridging provision between them. Each technical route would include a 2 year programme for 16–18 year olds to allow them to reach Level 2 or 3 and include formal work experience. It could be taken through college based technical education or an employer based apprenticeship. Each route would have progression pathways to higher skills. It is to be developed and accredited by a single licensed body or consortia and will be based on employer developed standards. A transition year would be possible for those young people not immediately ready for a specific technical route. The Government has welcomed these radical proposals from the Sainsbury Report and has issued a “Post 16 Skills Plan” describing how and when they will be implemented. \n",
