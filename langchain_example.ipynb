Second, firms also often said short-time horizons, preoccupied immediate demands running developing business looking far enough ahead contemplate need fill technician roles two three years time (Sims et al . 2000: 1; Lewis 2014c: 505; NASEM 2017: 77). problem, course, firms look far ahead, given long lead time involved technician training, workers question available needed.\n",
