New Study Reveals 1 in 10 UKWorkers have In-Demand AI Skills
APRIL 20, 2023
Salesforce, the global leader in CRM, today
released data revealing that just one in 10
UK workers feel they have AI skills –
further evidencing the digital skills crisis
currently facing the UK. With the rise of
transformative technologies like
generative AI, this represents a growing
concern for UK business.  
Generative AI has the potential to
fundamentally transform how work gets
done across all industries and workers
agree that AI skills are important. Nearly a

quarter of respondents rank AI skills as
among the top three most important
digital skills right now, and believe AI will
be the most important skill to have over
the next ﬁve years. Half understand how
this technology will impact their work and
job. 
However, 3 in 4 (75%) of UK workers say
they do not feel ready to operate in a
digital world. And whilst the same
percentage report using digital skills in
their day-to-day, few report skills beyond
collaboration technology, digital
administration, and digital project
management.
Salesforce’s research points to a lack of
digital conﬁdence across the UK
workforce, and the need for business to
better explain just how accessible digital
skills can be – especially those related to
AI.

“UK workers report AI, coding and app
development as the fastest growing and
most in-demand digital skills today. But
not everyone needs to learn how to code
in the generative AI era,” said Zahra
Bahrololoumi, CEO, Salesforce UKI. “Like
all technology, generative AI will need
deep machine learning experts and
engineers as much as it will creatives and
storytellers – people who understand how
to work alongside AI, building on the
content it generates. It’s about showing
people where exactly, and often how
easily, they can ﬁt into the digital-ﬁrst
workplace.
Employees recognise thevalue of AI
More UK workers are excited about
generative AI’s use in their workplace
(49%) than worried about it replacing
them in their job (38%). This is in line
with interest from management: almost
half (46%) of UK people leaders say that
their company is considering ways to use
generative AI.
Workers clearly recognise that the path
forward requires reskilling, and want to be
part of it. An emphatic 96% believe
businesses should prioritise AI skills as
part of the strategy to develop their
workforce.

use generative AIand integrate thistechnologyeﬀectively andresponsibly,businesses willcontinue to facebarriers to successfulimplementation.
ZAHRA BAHROLOULOUMI, CEO,SALESFORCE UKI
“This is a watershed moment for the tech
industry. Digital transformation remains
ﬁrmly at the top of the CEO agenda and
many leaders that I speak to see AI as a
game changer for their business – a tool to
better connect with their customers,
personalise experiences, and operate
more eﬃciently,” said Bahrololoumi.
“However, AI is only as good as the data
that serves it and the people that work
with it. Without the necessary skills and
knowledge of how to use generative AI
and integrate this technology eﬀectively
and responsibly, businesses will continue
to face barriers to successful
implementation.”
The UK is moving towardsskills-based hiring
The vast majority (87%) of UK workers
consider skills-based experience more
important than a degree when trying to
land a job in today’s market.

This reﬂects a shift by companies toward
skills-based hiring at all levels. Most people
leaders (82%) surveyed say that skills are
the most important attribute when
evaluating candidates. Only 18% believe
that relevant degrees are the most
important.
It’s a transformative approach to
recruitment that stands to deliver better
business performance in several areas.
Over half of people leaders (55%) cite
talent retention as a key business beneﬁt
to skills-based hiring. Increased knowledge
sharing (48%) and workforce diversity
(42%) also rank highly.
Additionally, most people leaders believe
that prioritising employees’ digital skills
development will have similarly positive
impacts on business performance –
including increased productivity (47%),
team performance (43%), and problem-
solving capabilities (40%).
Employees rank digital skills training as the
second most important workplace beneﬁt,
over and above pay bonuses and
wellbeing beneﬁts. How people work, and
what they value about their jobs, is
fundamentally changing in the digital-ﬁrst
era.

Salesforce is urging UK business and
government to work together to establish
a national online digital skills platform to
