Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
Ministerial foreword
Finance is the lifeblood of growing economies. It ﬂows through the arteries of tradeand commerce, feeding enterprise and innovation, and turning great ideas intothriving businesses. But it is particularly critical during times of industrial andtechnological change – like now. Britain has just 27 years to become a net zeroeconomy effectively ending our contribution to climate change by 2050. We alsohave to reverse the decline in nature and adapt to our changing climate. We mustalso protect ourselves from volatile international energy markets resulting fromPutin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. The environmental and economic rewards of thistransformation will be immense – but the challenges involved will be great. We notonly need pioneering ﬁrms and entrepreneurs to create green products andservices. We also need the right support structure to propel them to commercialsuccess. That is why the government’s new Green Finance Strategy is so crucial.
We have led the world on green ﬁnance. We were the ﬁrst major country to publisha green ﬁnance strategy in 2019. In 2021, we placed ﬁnance at the heart of ourCOP26 Presidency and became the ﬁrst G20 nation to require the largestcompanies and ﬁnancial ﬁrms to make public how they are responding to ﬁnancialrisks and opportunities from climate change. We established a UK InfrastructureBank with £22 billion of capital to level up and decarbonise our economy. And wehave raised over £26 billion through selling green gilts. All these measures havegiven us a strong head start in the race to ﬁnance the green Industrial Revolution.
But to decarbonise in 27 years, and meet our environmental objectives as set out inour Environmental Improvement Plan, and deliver energy security, we will require astep-change in levels of investment. The global transition to a resilient, nature-positive, net zero economy will see trillions of pounds reallocated and invested intonew technologies, services and infrastructure. There are huge opportunities for theUK’s ﬁnancial and professional services industry in this transition. From venturecapital supporting climate and nature tech solutions, to banks funding majorrenewables projects, we want our world-leading ﬁnancial services sector to driveevery step of the global transition.
We also need to tackle the risks from climate change and environmentaldegradation. From increasingly frequent and severe weather events causingdamage to infrastructure and supply chains, to changing consumer expectationsand preferences shifting demand for certain products and services, companies andtheir investors need the right policies in place to support them in managing theserisks and avoiding stranded assets. Acting now is also important to minimise theﬁscal risks of the transition and maximise the growth opportunities – the costs ofinaction are signiﬁcantly higher.
The Green Finance Strategy represents the latest policy blueprint - developed byHM Treasury, the new Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, andDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs - to seize this opportunity,mitigate those risks and ensure the necessary ﬁnance ﬂows to our net zero, energysecurity and environmental industries. The Strategy sets out how the UK

government will pursue its ambition to become the world’s ﬁrst Net Zero-alignedFinancial Centre – equipping the market with the information and tools necessary todrive the transition. We are setting out next steps on transition planning and the UKGreen Taxonomy to ensure green ﬁnance markets are robust.
The Strategy also sets out how UK government is working with a range of publicﬁnancing bodies to commercialise and ﬁnance the green technologies needed forthe transition, complementing steps taken through Powering Up Britain, to delivercheap, clean British energy sources to heat our homes and power our industries.Together, these steps will boost economic growth across the country, creatingalmost half a million new green jobs and opportunities for businesses to export theirexpertise around the world.
Nature sustains economies and livelihoods, and protecting and restoring nature isinseparable from addressing climate change. This Strategy incorporates bothnature and climate adaptation into our green ﬁnance framework. We are alsopublishing a new nature markets framework alongside the Strategy, to explain howwe will develop high-integrity markets enabling farmers and land managers toattract investment into natural capital.
Finally, the Strategy sets out how the UK will use our leadership and the expertiseof our ﬁnancial sector to accelerate the shift to a green global ﬁnancial system andcatalyse green ﬁnancing globally, including in emerging and developing markets.These economies are crucial for tackling climate change and halting nature’sdecline, as well as being key partners for the UK in generating shared prosperityfrom the global transition.
The next 3 decades will see the biggest changes to industry since the 19th century,as we move from a fossil-fuel driven economy to a decarbonised one that leavesour environment in a better state than we found it. Our ability to exploit theopportunities of this new Green Industrial Revolution will depend on our readinessto ﬁnance it. This document explains how we will achieve our objectives.

Executive summary1. Climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental degradation aretransforming the global economy. As countries, companies and individuals acrossthe world respond to these challenges, ﬁnance and investment have a crucial roleto play. The global transition to a net zero, resilient and nature positive economywill see trillions of pounds reallocated and invested in new projects, products andservices. The UK’s world-renowned ﬁnance sector can put us at the forefront of thistransition.
2. The UK’s COP26 Presidency in 2021 generated historic momentum in thenumbers of businesses, regions and investors seeking to align with climate andenvironmental goals. Over 90% of global GDP is now covered by national net zerotargets. In the ﬁnancial services sector this was exempliﬁed through thecommitment of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), which unitesover 550 members across the ﬁnancial sector committed to align with a net zerofuture, spanning 50 countries and representing 40% of global private ﬁnancialassets.[footnote 1] Now is the time for the UK to build on that leadership.
3. The transition is not only an environmental imperative, but a growth opportunityfor the UK. Supplying the goods and services necessary to reach global net zeroambitions is estimated to be worth up to £1 trillion to UK businesses to 2030[footnote2]. Furthermore, exports within low carbon and renewable energy industries aregrowing signiﬁcantly faster than exports from the broader economy. Between 2020and 2021, it is estimated exports from these sectors increased by 67%, comparedto total exports which increased by 6%.[footnote 3]
4. The 2023 Green Finance Strategy (‘this Strategy’) is an update to the UK’s 2019Green Finance Strategy and sets out how continued UK leadership on greenﬁnance will cement the UK’s place at the forefront of this growing global market,and how we will mobilise the investment needed to meet our climate and natureobjectives. Published alongside this Strategy are the UK government’s PoweringUp Britain, Nature Markets Framework, International Climate Finance Strategy andUK 2030 Strategic Framework for Climate and Nature. Collectively thesepublications conﬁrm the UK’s ambition to address climate and environmentalchallenges, and the practical steps we are taking to drive progress.
What are our objectives?5. This Strategy aims to reinforce and expand the UK’s position as a world leaderon green ﬁnance and investment, delivering 5 key objectives:

Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
a. UK ﬁnancial services growth and competitiveness – The UK can and willdo more to support our ﬁnancial services sector to prosper from a transitioningglobal economy. From venture capital supporting innovative climate techsolutions, to banks lending to major renewables projects and asset managersallocating capital to support the companies of the future – behind every step ofour transition will be our world-leading ﬁnancial services sector.b. Investment in the green economy – Private investment will be crucial todelivering net zero, building climate resilience and supporting nature’s recovery.We estimate that to deliver on the UK’s net zero ambitions, through the late2020s and 2030s, an additional £50-60 billion capital investment will berequired each year.[footnote 4] A 2021 report estimated that over the next 10years, our domestic nature-related goals could require between £44-97 billion ofinvestment[footnote 5]. This investment will support the sectors and technologiesof the future, enable traditional sectors to adapt and thrive as part of thetransition, and presents a signiﬁcant opportunity to level up the UK, includingthose parts with an industrial heritage.c. Financial stability – Climate change and environmental degradation poseprofound risks to the economy. The Bank of England projected £110 billion inadditional losses for UK banks out to 2050 in their disorderly transition scenario,and 50-70% higher losses for UK insurers in their highest climate risk scenario.[footnote 6] Similarly, over half the world’s GDP is generated in sectors thatdepend on the goods and services nature provides.[footnote 7] An effective greenﬁnance framework will ensure the ﬁnance sector has the information it needs tomanage risks from climate change and nature loss.d. Incorporation of nature and adaptation – There has been signiﬁcantprogress on nature ﬁnance both domestically and internationally since 2019,culminating in the commitments on ﬁnance made in the landmark Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework agreed at the UN Convention onBiological Diversity COP 15 in December 2022. There is also increasingrecognition of the government’s critical role in supporting private investment inclimate resilience, as highlighted by the Climate Change Committee’s recentreport.[footnote 8] To reﬂect these developments, as well as calls from industry foran integrated approach, this Strategy will explicitly incorporate both nature andclimate adaptation into the government’s green ﬁnance policy framework.e. Alignment of global ﬁnancial ﬂows with climate and nature objectives –With our world leading expertise and outward looking ﬁnancial sector, the UK isstrategically placed to collaborate with international partners to support thealignment of global ﬁnancial frameworks and stimulate investment towardsemerging and developing markets where capital needs are highest. The UK cancapture a huge economic opportunity by supporting the global transition, whilstbuilding closer relationships with high growth emerging markets and developingeconomies as they seek to meet their own ﬁnancing needs.
Chapter 1: Foundations – UK approach to green ﬁnance
6. The UK is recognised as a leading green ﬁnance centre internationally[footnote 9].This is in large part due to the strength and innovation of UK industry, and has been

Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
supported by our strong policy framework. From the 2019 Green Finance Strategyto the 2021 Greening Finance Roadmap, the UK government has showncommitment to taking the required steps so industry can deliver. Through our callfor evidence (early summer 2022), 134 leading stakeholders across the businessand investment community provided clear feedback on where government actionwas needed.
7. A key area of feedback in the call for evidence was transition ﬁnance, whereﬁnancial markets raised the need for continued innovation to provide products andservices that support higher emitting companies to decarbonise and reduce theirenvironmental impact. To support this, the UK government will commission anindustry-led market review into how the UK can enhance our position and becomethe best place in the world for raising transition capital.
Chapter 2: Align – Enabling the market to align with UKclimate and environmental goals
8. Mobilising private capital into the sectors and technologies needed to deliver netzero and our wider environmental targets requires market participants to have theright information and tools to assess opportunities and risks effectively.Stakeholders have been clear there is a role for the UK government to facilitateﬁnancial markets to deliver this, as well as to ensure green ﬁnance markets arerobust and that protections against greenwashing are in place for consumers.
9. This Strategy outlines how the UK government will pursue its ambition tobecome the world’s ﬁrst Net Zero-aligned Financial Centre. This Strategy will showhow the UK government will provide transparency, support the development ofmarket tools, and support transmission channels to allow the ﬁnancial sector toalign with net zero.
10. We will deliver on our commitments in ‘Greening Finance: A Roadmap toSustainable Investing’, ensuring market participants have the information and datathey need to manage risks and allocate capital where there are opportunities:
a. Currently the Financial Conduct Authority requires listed companies, as wellas large asset owners and managers to disclose transition plans on a ‘complyor explain’ basis. The government commits to consulting on theintroduction of requirements for the UK’s largest companies to disclosetheir transition plans if they have them. To ensure parity between listed andprivate companies, as well as to ensure requirements are consistent andcomparable across the economy, we expect to consult on the basis that theserequirements could align closely with those of the FCA, including the ‘comply orexplain’ basis. This is supported by the UK government-convened TransitionPlan Taskforce (TPT), currently developing best practice for companies andinvestors seeking to disclose transition plans, ensuring quality and consistency.The consultation will take place in Autumn / Winter 2023, once the TPT hasﬁnalised its framework.b. We will continue to support the work of the International FinancialReporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation’s new standard-setting board –

the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) – and will set up aframework to assess these standards for their suitability for adoption in the UKas soon as the ﬁnal standards are published (expected summer 2023).c. We will launch a call for evidence on Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG)emissions reporting[footnote 10], to better understand the costs and beneﬁts ofproducing and using this information. We will update the EnvironmentalReporting Guidelines, including for Streamlined Energy and CarbonReporting[footnote 11], which provides voluntary guidance for UK organisations.d. In response to the Climate Change Committee’s report ‘Investment for a well-adapted UK’, we will work with industry partners to improve the approach toclimate resilience assessment and disclosure through the development ofadaptation metrics and guidance. Our ﬁnal approach will be set out alongsideour adaptation ﬁnance deliverables and action plan in 2024.
11. The UK government will also support industry as it develops the new marketframeworks, associated tools and expertise required to expand green ﬁnanceactivity.
a. We will deliver a UK Green Taxonomy – a tool to provide investors withdeﬁnitions of which economic activities should be labelled as green. This willsupport the quality of standards, labels and disclosures used in the industry forgreen ﬁnance activity. We expect to consult on the Taxonomy in Autumn 2023.The government proposes that nuclear - as a key technology within ourpathways to reach net zero - will be included within the UK’s Green Taxonomy,subject to consultation. After the Taxonomy has been ﬁnalised, we will initiallyexpect companies to report voluntarily against it for a period of at least 2reporting years after which we will explore mandating disclosures. Governmentdoes not wish to place undue burdens onto companies whose size or scalemakes the disclosure of taxonomy-related information unreasonable. Therefore,we will develop proposals with proportionality in mind.b. We will address the growing Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG)investment trends to ensure this activity is robust and protects UK markets and,ultimately, consumers. Alongside this Strategy we have published a consultationon regulating ESG ratings providers to seek views on how regulation couldhelp ensure better outcomes for these products.[footnote 12] We will continue toact as observers, alongside the Financial Conduct Authority, to the industry-ledworking group that is developing an ESG Data and Ratings Code of Conductto promote best practice in the market.c. We will ensure the UK is the home of sustainable ﬁnance skills, expertise andprofessional development. We will re-launch the Green Finance EducationCharter, which will expand to encompass more professional bodies, broaden itsremit to include nature, and continue to work with counterparts globally topromote and replicate the successful Charter model.
12. The UK government will explore the actions it can take to enable keytransmission channels through which ﬁnancial markets can support businessesto grow as part of a net zero, resilient and nature positive economy. This willinclude:

a. Access to liquidity: We will work closely with industry and the regulator toimplement Solvency UK, creating the potential for over £100 billion ofproductive investments from insurers in the next 10 years, all while maintaininghigh standards of policyholder protection.b. Effective investor stewardship: We will work with the Financial ConductAuthority, Financial Reporting Council and the Pensions Regulator to review theregulatory framework for the effective stewardship that is crucial to climate andenvironmental oversight, including the operation of the UK Stewardship Code.c. Fiduciary duty: The Department for Work and Pensions will examine theextent their Stewardship Guidance is being followed in late 2023. Governmentwill engage with interested stakeholders on how we can continue to clarifyﬁduciary duty through a series of roundtables and a working group of theFinancial Markets and Law Committee.
13. We will work closely with ﬁnancial regulators – such as the Bank of England,Financial Conduct Authority, Financial Reporting Council and The PensionsRegulator – and the environmental regulator in England, the Environment Agency,to ensure that the UK’s regulatory framework supports the growth of green ﬁnance.14. We will collaborate with international partners to accelerate the alignment ofglobal ﬁnancial ﬂows with a net zero, resilient and nature positive global economythrough:
a. Championing action to align the global ﬁnancial system by supportingequal ambition by other countries and ensuring interoperable approaches. Thisincludes leveraging our position and using our voice at key global negotiationsand forums such as the G20, G7, Coalition of Finance Ministers for ClimateAction and International Platform for Sustainable Finance.b. Driving the alignment of development ﬁnance, working with internationalﬁnancial institutions and the wider donor community. This includes fulﬁlling ourcommitment to align all new bilateral UK Ofﬁcial Development Assistance(ODA) with the Paris Agreement in 2023; delivering our 2021 commitment toensure all bilateral ODA spending does no harm to nature, and stopping anynew direct ﬁnancial or promotional support for the fossil fuel energy sectoroverseas, other than in exceptional circumstances.c. Building partnerships with emerging markets and developingeconomies to support the growth and alignment of their ﬁnance sectors,including actions to enhance sharing of lessons from green ﬁnanceimplementation in the UK.
Chapter 3: Invest – Mobilising and creating opportunities forgreen investment
15. The economic transformation required to meet our climate and natureobjectives will create investment opportunities across the economy. The UKbusiness and investment landscape is one of the most competitive, attractive andinnovative in the world, and we will ensure we are using all levers available tomobilise private capital into the key sectors, projects and technologies needed totransition to a net zero, resilient and nature positive global economy. Since 2010,

Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
the UK has seen £198 billion of investment into low carbon energy, through amixture of government funding, private investment and levies on consumer bills.
16. The UK government has already introduced a range of new measures tomobilise and attract private investment. We committed £30 billion of domesticinvestment for the green industrial revolution at Spending Review 2021, as well as£6 billion for energy efﬁciency at the Autumn Statement 2022 and up to £20 billionfor CCUS announced at Spring Budget 2023. We are now seeing a step-change inthe UK, with annual investment in low carbon sectors more than doubling in realterms over the past 5 years. Across 2021 and 2022 alone, over £50 billion of newinvestments were delivered in low carbon sectors in the UK.[footnote 13]
17. We are providing clarity on pathways for investment across our net zero,nature and adaptation in the UK:
a. Alongside this Strategy, we are publishing Powering Up Britain which sets outhow we are taking bold action to achieve our energy security and net zeroobjectives. Through our Environmental Improvement Plan we set out how wewill work with land managers, communities and businesses to improve thenatural environment. Together these communicate the UK’s plan to growgreen investment across all parts of the UK, including by:
i. Providing up to £20 billion funding for early deployment of CarbonCapture, Usage and Storage (CCUS). This unprecedented level of fundingwill unlock private investment and the creation of jobs across the UK,particularly in the East Coast, North West of England and North Wales, andkick-start the delivery of subsequent phases of this new sustainable industryin the UK;ii. Announcing a suite of developments aiming to increase deployment oflow carbon hydrogen in the UK. These include conﬁrming the ﬁrst 15winning projects from the £240 million Net Zero Hydrogen Fund and the 2CCUS-enabled hydrogen projects moving forward on the Track-1 clusters,and publishing a shortlist of 20 projects we intend to enter due diligence withfor the ﬁrst electrolytic hydrogen allocation round;
iii. Launching Great British Nuclear (GBN), which will be an arms-length bodyresponsible for driving delivery of new nuclear projects. GBN will be backedwith the funding it needs, and we will work with GBN to publish a roadmap laterthis year;
iv. Announcing plans for the Great British Insulation Scheme, based onproposals announced last year as ECO+, which will deliver £1 billionadditional investment by March 2026 in energy efﬁciency upgrades, such asloft and cavity wall insulation; andv. Launching the up to £160 million Floating Offshore WindManufacturing Investment Scheme to kick start investment in portinfrastructure projects needed to deliver our ﬂoating offshore windambitions.
b. Throughout 2023, we will develop and publish a series of net zeroinvestment roadmaps. These will articulate investment needs by sector

Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
alongside summarising the relevant government policy and funding to make thesector investable. We will also publish a roadmap to guide nature positiveinvestment in key sectors by 2024. We will engage with investors, acrosssectors, to ensure these contain the information and clarity that will supportinvestment decisions.c. We are working with external partners to better track private investment intothe net zero economy and building towards a fuller way of tracking greeninvestment ﬂows in the UK – including annual private ﬁnance ﬂows intonature’s recovery in England.
18. We will use government and other public levers to mobilise private investment,providing investors with conﬁdence to invest in green technologies at differentstage of commercial maturity. In addition to measures set out in the ‘Powering UpBritain’ and ‘Environmental Improvement Plan’:
a. We will intensify work with the public ﬁnance institutions and welcome thejoint statement they have made today supporting the Strategy. The UK’s publicﬁnance institutions and UK’s export credit agency, UK Export Finance, play akey role in supporting sectors and technologies across to commercial maturityand scale:
i. The UK Infrastructure Bank (UKIB) is a UK government-owned policybank with £22 billion of ﬁnancial capacity across its private and localauthority lending arms. Its mission is to partner with the private sector andgovernment to increase infrastructure investment to help to tackle climatechange and promote economic growth across the UK. As of 27 March 2023,it has announced 12 deals, investing approximately £1.2 billion andunlocking over £5 billion of private capital.ii. The British Business Bank (BBB) is a government-owned economicdevelopment bank established by the UK government. BBB supportsaccess to ﬁnance for smaller businesses to drive sustainable growth andprosperity across the UK, and also to enable the transition to a net zeroeconomy. Between 2014 and end of August 2022, BBB supported £505million of equity investment in clean technology companies.iii. UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) is a non-departmental public bodyof the UK government that directs research, innovation and skills funding. Itbrings together 7 disciplinary research councils, Research England which isfocused on higher education institutions, and the UK’s innovation agency,Innovate UK. Between 2015 and 2020 Innovate UK supported 5,940companies with £1.9 billion of net zero related grants.iv. The UK’s export credit agency, UK Export Finance’s (UKEF) mission isto advance prosperity by ensuring no viable UK export fails for lack ofﬁnance or insurance, doing that sustainably and at no net cost to thetaxpayer. Alongside this Strategy the Chancellor has announced anincrease in UKEF’s capacity from £50 billion to £60 billion to support UKexporters and supply chains. UKEF is committed to increasing its support inclean growth and climate adaptation.
b. We will also work with the Green Finance Institute to explore how blendedﬁnance models might be used to more strategically mobilise private ﬁnance to

support our green objectives. This builds on the example we have set throughthe £30 million of seed capital we are investing into the Big Nature Impact Fund(BNIF), which will leverage private sector investment in a range of natureprojects in England.
19. We are supporting the creation and promotion of investment opportunitiesthroughout the economy:
a. We will support local authorities to develop their ability to attract privateinvestment through the work of the Local Net Zero Hubs and the UKIB, as wellas through promotion of programmes such as the Local Investment in NaturalCapital programme and Investment Zones. This is alongside plans topromote net zero investment in the 8 Freeports across England, 2 in Scotlandand 2 in Wales.b. We have the joint most generous capital allowance regime in the OECDwith a policy of full expensing from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2026. From April2023 we announced a higher rate of R&D Expenditure Credit – which meansthat the UK’s R&D tax relief for large companies has the joint highest uncappedheadline rate in the G7 – and an increased rate of relief for loss-making R&Dintensive SMEs.c. We will establish a new partnership with business and ﬁnance leaders tosupport the delivery of our net zero target, forming a shared view of the actionsneeded through a new Net Zero Business & Investment Group.d. We will host the Global Investment Summit in September 2023. This will buildon the Global Investment Summit held in 2021, at which governmentannounced nearly £10 billion of new foreign direct investments in the UK.
20. We will provide the clarity that stakeholders have called for to unlock voluntarymarkets for carbon and nature whilst ensuring environmental integrity – creatinginnovative new markets for green investment:
a. We will consult on the speciﬁc steps and interventions needed tosupport the growth of high integrity voluntary markets and protect againstgreenwashing. This will position the UK to serve as a global hub for voluntarycarbon trading.b. We have published alongside this Strategy a new Nature MarketsFramework, which sets out principles and priorities for the development ofhigh-integrity markets to enable farmers and land managers to attractinvestment in natural capital, and our plans to develop a comprehensive suite ofnature investment standards.
21. Drawing lessons from our domestic leadership and expertise from our ﬁnancialsector, the UK will support emerging and developing economies (EMDEs) togrow sustainably while creating opportunities for shared prosperity. Utilising a rangeof levers, including delivering on our commitment to provide £11.6 billion inInternational Climate Finance (ICF) between 2021/22 and 2025/26, the UK will:
a. Deepen our country partnerships and build green ﬁnance capability,including by co-delivering the Just Energy Transition Partnerships in SouthAfrica, Vietnam and Indonesia and supporting country plans to mobilise ﬁnance.

b. Provide strategic investment and enhance the scale of investmentopportunities, including through British International Investment, the UK’sdevelopment ﬁnance institution, which has invested over $1.7 billion of climateﬁnance since 2018; and building on the £5.2 billion in private investmentalready mobilised through our ICF[footnote 14].c. Develop innovative approaches to unlock private ﬁnance, such asthrough the new Climate Investment Funds Capital Market Mechanism, which isexpected to issue green bonds in the region of $5-7 billion for climate projects inEMDEs using returns from previous UK investments.d. Achieve global impact through the reform of the international ﬁnancialarchitecture by championing the Bridgetown Agenda, supporting theimplementation of the IMF Resilience and Sustainability Trust, and promotinggreater use of guarantees to allow scarce public ﬁnance to go further.e. Enable private investment in international climate adaptation, includingtripling ICF funding for adaptation from £500 million in 2019 to £1.5 billion in2025, and building our support for new approaches in Disaster Risk Financing.
Chapter 1: Foundations – UK approach togreen ﬁnance
1.1 Meeting global climate and environmental challenges
1. The twin threats of climate change and biodiversity decline are increasinglybeing felt at home and abroad. From extreme summer heat in the UK, todevastating ﬂoods in Pakistan and the loss and fragmentation of habitats globally,all around us the imperative to transition to net zero, adapt to climate change andhalt nature and biodiversity loss is becoming increasingly acute.
2. Addressing these challenges poses economic opportunity for early movers.Signiﬁcant upfront public and private capital will be needed. Between 2023 and2050, $150 trillion of total investment in the energy transition will be required for theworld to align with a 1.5 degree pathway. This requires annual investments toquadruple from current levels.[footnote 15] Additionally, $275–400 billion per year willbe required by 2030 for increased protection and restoration of nature.[footnote 16]However, these investments can unlock signiﬁcant returns and economicopportunities: estimates suggest every dollar spent on transforming the globalenergy system provides a payoff of at least $3 and potentially more than $7[footnote17], and every dollar spent on investing in more resilient infrastructure in low- andmiddle-income countries provides $4 in beneﬁts.[footnote 18]
3. The economic growth potential of the UK and global transition is a keyconsideration behind this Strategy. From the growth of new technologies toinvestment in infrastructure and the increasing demand for nature-based solutions,there are major opportunities for early movers. To secure this economic growthpotential, we have the joint most generous capital allowance regime in the OECD,as well as generous R&D and patent tax reliefs. The UK is also pioneering

breakthrough technologies and investing in world class data and analytics, forexample through the Centre for Greening Finance and Investment, a researchconsortium led by the University of Oxford and funded by UK Research &Innovation.
4. The UK has led by example by setting out world-leading climate and naturetargets. To meet each of these commitments, private ﬁnance will be critical, andthat is why the UK has placed it at the centre of our efforts. Using this strongdomestic record, we’ve worked to ensure ﬁnance is equally central in globalagreements, including by working with our international partners to ensure thealignment of ﬁnancial ﬂows was captured in the long-term goals of the ParisAgreement, and the targets in the Kunming-Montreal Global BiodiversityFramework.
5. This Strategy ensures that the UK is better equipped to meet our domesticand international climate and environmental targets (see Table 1 below),seizing the opportunity for UK growth in this expanding ﬁeld and maximising therole of private ﬁnance to meet climate and nature commitments affordably.

1.2 The UK green ﬁnance growth opportunity
6. Green ﬁnance is any structured ﬁnancial activity – a product or service – that hasbeen created to ensure a better environmental outcome. It includes an array ofloans, debt mechanisms and investments that are used to encourage thedevelopment of green projects or manage the impact of climate change oninvestments. Finance is a critical enabler for transitioning the real economy. Assuch, developing the right ﬁnancial expertise and attracting the right capital to theUK is central to delivering our transition.
7. We estimate that in 2022 alone, £23 billion of new low carbon investment wasdelivered in the UK – ranging from renewables, hydrogen, carbon capture andstorage, nuclear, sustainable materials, energy storage, electriﬁed transport, toclean heat.[footnote 19]
8. Given the scale of the transition needed at home and abroad, there is a growingdemand for green ﬁnancial services. Global Environmental, Social and Governance(ESG) assets under management (AUM) have increased from $2.2 trillion in 2015to $18.4 trillion in 2021 and are predicted to reach $34 trillion in 2026.[footnote 20]ESG-oriented AUM is set to grow much faster than the asset and wealthmanagement market as a whole. Unlocking the potential of green ﬁnance is,therefore, integral to the vision set out in the Chancellor’s 2022 Autumn Statement– for both ﬁnancial services and green industries to be key growth sectors for theUK.

9. In practice, this translates into asset owners allocating capital to large-scalerenewables projects to power homes and businesses; asset managers developingnew funds to service clients’ growing demand for exposure to green and transitionindustries; green companies raising money through capital markets to ﬁnance theirgrowth and expansion. Behind every transaction, sits a team of ﬁnancial, legal, dataand accountancy experts with the skills and expertise to move deals through tocompletion. This presents a huge opportunity for the UK ﬁnancial sector. Not justfor ﬁnancial services ﬁrms themselves, but also the growing ecosystem ofprofessional services, technical experts and businesses that support them.Adaptation ﬁnance is yet to achieve the same level of momentum. This Strategysets out how we intend to create the conditions for more private money to ﬂow intoensuring the UK’s climate action and resilience.
10. The growth opportunity of fulﬁlling our common climate and nature goalsdepends on international collaboration. For ﬁnance, this means developingcommon or aligned approaches to greening ﬁnancial frameworks - to remove, notcreate barriers to cross-border investment. Bringing global green sectors andtechnologies to commercial viability will require coordination, the sharing ofexpertise, and frictionless ﬂow of capital to the right companies and projects.Furthermore, the UK recognises the unique challenges and growth potential inemerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), and we are committed tobuilding strong partnerships which remove barriers to growth and generate mutualprosperity.
1.3 Foundations – UK green ﬁnance progress so far
11. The UK ﬁnancial services industry has made signiﬁcant progress in developingitself as a global green ﬁnance centre. The strength, maturity and international roleof the UK’s ﬁnancial sector is proven not just in volume but also in its globalpresence. This, combined with the UK’s leadership on climate and nature at apolitical and business level, has solidiﬁed its position as a leading centre for greenﬁnance, which continues to attract capital and talent. Given the scale of theopportunity available, it will be critical for the UK to maintain this position, and thepublication of this Strategy sets out a number of steps government is taking to thatend.
Box 1: UK ranked 1st on Global Green Finance Index
London has been ranked on the Global Green Finance Index[footnote 21] as theleading green ﬁnancial centre for a third consecutive year. The rankingconsiders 149 quantitative factors, as well as a worldwide survey of ﬁnanceprofessionals, focusing on 4 broad areas of competitiveness: business

1.3.1 Action by UK government13. UK leadership has largely been a function of the vision and innovation seenthroughout industry. However, it is recognised that the UK’s strong green ﬁnancepolicy framework has been a core supporting pillar of success so far. From the ﬁrstGreen Finance Strategy in 2019, this government has been delivering on policycommitments and building a world-leading framework.

2022: The International Development Strategy set out our commitment toensure our bilateral ODA becomes ‘nature positive’, aligning with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and the international goal to halt andreverse biodiversity loss by 2030.
1.3.2 Action by devolved administrations14. The UK government is working closely with devolved administration partners toachieve our greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Our net zero target coversthe whole of the UK, and all parts of the UK have an integral role to play indelivering the UK’s carbon budgets leading up to 2050.
15. While green ﬁnance policy in the UK is reserved, and applies across the UK,there are a number of initiatives underway across Scotland, Wales and NorthernIreland to catalyse investment into net zero and nature’s recovery.
Scottish Government16. The Scottish Government will ensure that Scotland’s ﬁnancial services industry,with Edinburgh the second largest ﬁnancial centre in the UK, plays a key role indelivering the UK’s net zero targets. The ﬁnancial sector is developing capacity inthis space, including through transparent and effective ﬁnancial reporting. Somekey actions being taken include:
a. Launching the Scottish Taskforce on Green and Sustainable FinancialServices, which coordinates industry to secure Scotland’s place as a globallyrecognised green ﬁnance centre;b. supporting the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD)as members of the TNFD forum;c. Expansion of the Green Investment Portfolio, which will allow the ScottishGovernment to present new projects which demonstrate Scotland is a worldleader in future innovative green industries supporting net zero. The Portfoliohas a current value of approx. £3.7 billion, with around £300 million privateinvestment already invested into projects and approx. £875 million currentlyunder offer or in active discussions;d. Continuing to develop the Funding to Finance approach, which aims tosecure consistent project pipeline, and to close the investment gap by 2030;e. Establishment of the Scottish National Investment Bank (SNIB) to deploycommercial, mission-focused investment. SNIB invests in projects,communities, and scaling businesses to deliver positive environmental,economic and social impacts for the people of Scotland, and has a particularfocus on catalysing and crowding in private capital. SNIB engages regularlywith UK-wide public ﬁnance institutions, particularly the UK Infrastructure Bankand British Business Bank, and works collaboratively with them where there iscommonality between their remits. Since its launch S N I B has committed £227million to net zero investments;

f. Commitment to develop Scottish Government Interim Principles forResponsible Investment in Natural Capital, a values-led, high-integritymarket for responsible private investment in natural capital. This commitment issupported by the Interim Principles for Responsible Investment in NaturalCapital, which have been cited as illustrating good practice by the UK’s FinanceNature Recovery initiative, and by the launch of the Facility for InvestmentReady Nature in Scotland (FIRNS), a £1.8 million investment readiness fund.
Welsh Government17. The Welsh Government recognises the role of the ﬁnancial services industry insupporting the investment required for Wales to play its role in delivering the UK’sNet Zero targets and biodiversity action. It is committed to ensuring that investmentsupports a just transition in Wales and as such is working in partnership to identifyappropriate ﬁnancing models, coordinate and deliver investment for Net ZeroWales and the 30x30 biodiversity target. Some key actions being taken include:
a. Establishment of the Ministerial Portfolio for Climate Change in 2021, withan annual budget of over £2 billion to support Net Zero and tackle biodiversityloss in Wales.b. Supporting ﬁnancial disclosures and accounting in Wales through thedelivery of Innovation and Digital strategies.c. Continuing the Welsh Government Energy Service facilitating projectﬁnancing for public sector, community energy and decarbonisation schemes.d. Establishment of Sector and Regional Funds and Boards examplesincluding the Economy Futures Fund, Circular Economy Fund, City RegionDeals, Net Zero Industry Wales and Woodland Financing Group.e. Contributing to the Global Biodiversity Framework by developing an actionplan to deliver the 30x30 biodiversity target, including consideration of statutorybiodiversity targets, ethical and transparent private investment in naturerecovery.f. Commitment of the Development Bank of Wales to support Net Zero andclimate adaptation targets. This includes the launch of the Bank’s GreenBusiness Loan Scheme providing Welsh businesses with a package of supportto help them reduce carbon emissions and save on future energy bills.
Northern Ireland Executive18. The Northern Ireland Executive has a number of key growth and energy-relatedstrategies in place focusing on energy decarbonisation and growth of the greeneconomy – the Energy Strategy “Path to net zero”, the 10x Economic Vision(Department for the Economy) and the Green Growth Strategy (Department ofAgriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs). These strategies focus on deliveringself-sufﬁciency in affordable renewable energy whilst invigorating growth in theeconomy fuelled by green tech, skills and processes. Delivering decarbonisation atpace is in addition legislated by the Climate Change Act (NI) 2022 whilst the 10x

Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
Economic Vision paper delivers on the Energy Strategy target of doubling the sizeof Northern Ireland’s green economy to £2 billion by 2030 through 3 themes ofSustainability, Innovation and most crucially Inclusion – which is in line with Section75 of the Northern Ireland Act regarding equality in public duties. A range of keyenablers are proposed:
a. Through the Green Innovation Challenge Fund, the Department for theEconomy, in collaboration with DAERA, has developed key focus areas of NetZero Utilities, Net Zero Future Fuels, Soil Nutrient Separation, and AdvancedGaseous Storage. It is anticipated that the program will be live by 2024 to atleast £20 million range, subject to funding.b. Through the Green Growth Support Package, the Northern IrelandExecutive is collaborating with UK government and Innovate UK to potentiallylaunch a green growth support package during 2023 to deliver hydrogengeneration hubs, biofuels / synthetics / eFuels options, and eco parks. It alsosupports novel use of existing renewables to generate new zero emission fuelsand energy. Capital support remains subject to funding but is potentially up to£30 million.c. To support Energy and Resource Efﬁciency, Invest N I (economic deliverypartner to the Department for the Economy) provides technical consultancysupport to all Northern Ireland businesses with an annual energy and resourcespend in excess of £30,000. This support offers fully funded technical audits,feasibility studies, and advice, complete with a report and recommendations tohelp businesses identify cost and carbon savings through energy and resourceefﬁciency. The Resource Efﬁciency Capital Grant from Invest N I providessupport to eligible Invest N I client companies to help with the cost of investingin resource efﬁcient technologies that will drive savings and businessproductivity. Grants of up to £50,000 are available to help with the purchasing ofnew equipment. Invest N I also supports delivery of sustainability reportswhich are available to all Northern Ireland businesses with an annual energyand resource spend in excess of £30,000. The aim of such reports is to providea holistic assessment and understanding of a business’s environmentalperformance across a number of areas, such as Raw Materials, Energy,Carbon, Packaging, Biodiversity and Waste.
1.4 Building on our foundations – pillars of strategic actionfor green ﬁnance
19. In 2022, we issued a call for evidence to support the development of thisStrategy. The call for evidence asked stakeholders a range of questions to providea) an evaluation of the existing policy framework and b) gather evidence on wherefuture government policy could support industry to deliver on their ambitions. Wereceived 134 responses from ﬁnancial institutions, companies, trade associations,local authorities and NGOs. The call for evidence, and a series of associatedstakeholder engagement roundtables and workshops, has provided an accurateand timely picture of the policy issues most pressing to market participants. Asummary of the evidence and feedback is found in chapters 2 and 3.

1.4.1 The interaction between Align (greening ﬁnance) and Invest (ﬁnancinggreen)20. The remainder of this Strategy sets out 2 pillars of strategic action where theUK government will act to unlock green ﬁnance:
Chapter 2 - Align sets out the regulatory framework, tools and channels to enablethe ﬁnancial services sector to align activity with a pathway to a net zero, resilientand nature positive global economy – greening the ﬁnancial system.Chapter 3 - Invest outlines how government and public ﬁnance institutions aremobilising private capital into the sectors and technologies needed to deliver ourtargets - ﬁnancing our green objectives.
21. The Strategy also sets out how we are leveraging UK leadership to forge theway to a truly global green ﬁnancial system, thereby helping shift the trillionsneeded in private investment to meet global needs whilst building closerelationships with international partners.
22. For both domestic and international action, the steps taken within each chapterwill be highly complementary, with efforts to green the ﬁnancial system facilitatinginvestment at scale. To secure the objectives set out in the ‘Invest’ chapter, deliveryof ‘Align’ will be essential.
Box 3: The role of green ﬁnance in the global response to climate changeand biodiversity decline
The greening of global ﬁnancial systems is a pre-requisite for meetingﬁnancing needs in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs)where the bulk of investment to reach net zero, protect nature and adapt toclimate impacts need to take place. This is why the UK COP 26 Presidencyplaced an emphasis on driving mobilisation of ﬁnance from both public andprivate sources, coupling unprecedented commitments from the private sectorwith a clear plan for delivering on the $100 billion climate ﬁnance mobilisationgoal. This strategy represents a key part of our actions to facilitate the meetingof EMDE ﬁnancing needs, building on the ICF Strategy and the ‘UKgovernment’s strategy for international development.
EMDEs face immense challenges and are critical partners in deliveringeffective solutions to our collective climate and nature crises. We want to shareexpertise with these markets to facilitate increased ambition, to generateshared prosperity and accelerate the global transition in a just and inclusivemanner. This means working bilaterally to share UK ﬁnancial sector expertise;as well as working in collaboration with other countries, philanthropy and theprivate sector, through initiatives like the Just Energy Transition Partnerships. Italso means scaling innovative ﬁnancing instruments which are capable ofmobilising investment into harder to reach sectors and geographies, anddeveloping sustainable capital markets to leverage both local and internationalsources of ﬁnance.

[Page #24]
14/10/2023, 16:24
Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
Beyond our actions to further leverage the private sector, we will continue tostrengthen international support to deliver on the priorities of EMDEs,especially to those most vulnerable. This includes continuing to scale up publicﬁnance through the delivery of our £11.6 billion I C F commitment between2021/22 and 2025/26, including delivering a balanced split between support foradaptation and mitigation and investing at least £3 billion in the protection andrestoration of nature. We will continue to ensure that climate ﬁnance reachesthe communities who need it most, including through the UK-Fiji-led Taskforceon Access to Climate Finance and its country pilots in Bangladesh, Fiji,Jamaica, Rwanda and Uganda. Acknowledging that some impacts of climatechange are now irreversible, we will build on the progress made on fundingarrangements for loss and damage at recent COPs.
In tandem with our direct support for EMDEs, reforming the internationalﬁnancial architecture will lay the groundwork for system-wide change. The UKis taking a leading role, including by supporting the Bridgetown Agenda andoperationalisation of the IMF’s Resilience and Sustainability Trust. The UK iscalling for the Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) to unlock billions ofdollars in new lending by implementing the recommendations of the G20Review of MDBs’ Capital Adequacy Framework. We are championing the useof Climate Resilient Debt Clauses, with UK Export Finance becoming the ﬁrstbilateral Export Credit Agency to offer these. And we are supporting theCanada-led Global Carbon Pricing Challenge and its aim to triple the coverageof carbon pricing globally, which is critical for greening ﬁnance ﬂows.
As the cost and difﬁculty of action increases, the world must seize theopportunity to invest for our common future. Moving forward to setting thenew post-2025 goal on climate ﬁnance and implementing the GlobalBiodiversity Framework, it will be critical to use all forms of ﬁnance in delivery ofour climate and nature goals. That is why the UK will continue to emphasise theimportance of coherent international action to green the ﬁnancial sector, ofeffective use of concessional ﬁnance to protect the most vulnerable andmobilise private ﬁnance, and of reaching scale through the internationalﬁnancial architecture.
1.4.2 Transition ﬁnance23. Two areas stakeholders drew out in their feedback were a) the need forgovernment to support industry to develop and deploy innovative ﬁnancial productsand services to continue to attract international business, and b) the need forgovernment to work with industry to develop a high integrity approach to transitionﬁnancing.
Box 4: Description of transition ﬁnance
While green ﬁnance refers to the ﬁnancing of activities that can already bedeemed as ‘green’, ‘transition ﬁnance’ refers to ﬁnancial products and servicesthat support higher emitting companies and activities to become green. These

instruments are generally used by companies seeking to reduce greenhousegas emissions, and should be part of a credible decarbonisation pathway that isconsistent with global climate goals. Many of the products and services beingdeveloped for decarbonisation also have the potential to be used in companies’nature positive transition journeys.
24. Transition ﬁnance is especially relevant for heavy industries, which will need toundertake deep decarbonisation over a longer time period. Reaching net zero isgoing to require a whole economy transition, so decarbonising these industries willbe critical, and as such it is vital they are able to maintain access to ﬁnance. Inaddition to investment into new green activities, we need to ensure that hard toabate sectors with a long-term role to play can also access the ﬁnance they need totransition.
25. Financial markets have been increasingly innovating to provide products andservices that direct forward-looking capital to support higher emitters to ﬁnancegenuine transition. New instruments such as sustainability-linked loans and bondsand transition bonds have grown rapidly, unlocking a broader scope of investmentopportunities (see case study below). To uphold market integrity, transition ﬁnanceshould be consistent with global climate and nature goals and used by companieswith clear transition plans and quantiﬁed targets.
Box 5: Case study - British Airways sustainability linked ﬁnancing
In 2021, British Airways was the ﬁrst airline to receive a sustainability-linkedloan tied to one of its sustainability targets. British Airways entered into asustainability-linked asset-ﬁnancing structure (through Enhanced EquipmentTrust Certiﬁcates, commonly referred as EETCs), with a total of $785 millionraised to ﬁnance 7 new-generation fuel-efﬁcient aircraft. The certiﬁcates maturebetween 2031 and 2035. The interest rate payable is subject to an increase of0.25% points should British Airways fail to satisfy the SustainabilityPerformance Target for the ﬁnancial year ending 31 December 2025.
The Sustainability Performance Target selected for British Airways is to reduceCO2 intensity to 88.3 grams per passenger per kilometre ﬂown in 2025, an 8%reduction compared to 2019. This target is a key milestone for the work towardsthe parent company, IAG Group’s, long term goal to achieve net zero carbonemissions by 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement.
An independent second party opinion was obtained, which conﬁrmed that thecertiﬁcates align with the International Capital Market Association (ICMA)Sustainability-Linked Bond Principles.

26. It is vital that investor conﬁdence is upheld in the ambition, additionality andcomparability of the transition pathways that underpin transition ﬁnanceinstruments. There is a growing range of transition guidance and deﬁnitionsavailable in the market. The UK government will continue to support and promotemarket development of high integrity and innovative new transition ﬁnanceinstruments that are consistent with a pathway to net zero and the Paristemperature goal.
27. In 2019 the UK government launched the UK Centre for Greening Finance andInvestment (CGFI), a national centre established to accelerate the adoption anduse of climate and environmental data and analytics by ﬁnancial institutionsinternationally. Now, the University of Oxford, together with CGFI, is developing anew Transition Finance Centre of Excellence using funding from Banco Santander.The Centre will play a leading role in deﬁning aspects of transition ﬁnance such asbest practice sectoral transition plans and developing new capabilities forpractitioners.
28. Disclosure of transition plans (see Chapter 2: Align) will also enhance theavailability of reliable, comparable reporting on the transition pathways of UKcorporates and ﬁnancial institutions, and provide a robust evidence base for thetransition ﬁnance market. This will provide a mechanism for organisations todemonstrate to investors their long-term transition strategy and unlock ﬁnancialﬂows toward areas of the economy that need to transition.

1.4.3 Capturing the opportunity through a new Transition Finance MarketReview29. Innovations in transition ﬁnance are gathering pace. Now is an opportune timeto convene market experts to look systematically at how to ensure new transitionﬁnance instruments are developed and structured with high integrity and using UKbased ﬁnancial services expertise.
30. The UK government is commissioning a review into how the UK can becomethe best place in the world for raising transition capital. The Transition FinanceMarket Review will consider what the UK ﬁnancial and professional servicesecosystem needs to do to become a leading provider of transition ﬁnancial servicesand innovative instruments on the pathway to 2050. The review will research,develop ideas, identify opportunities, and showcase best practice. It will considerwhat market tools the private sector could provide that would be most impactful tocreate the conditions for:
a. Scaling transition focused capital raising with integrity, and the market fornew, innovative transition ﬁnance instruments (such as sustainability linked debtand transition bonds);b. Maximising the opportunity for UK based ﬁnancial services to develop,structure and export transition ﬁnance services; andc. Positioning the UK’s professional services ecosystem as a global hubsupporting this innovative activity (legal; accountancy; consultancy; data andanalytics; skills and education).
31. The Review will be led by an external expert, who will be supported by a panelof advisors, and a small secretariat. The review will leverage and align with ongoingTransition Plan Taskforce work (see section 2.2.2). It should look at internationalcomparisons, and prioritise international coherence and interoperability (consistentwith our goals in section 2.6.1). This Review will have regard to the UK ListingReview led by Lord Hill and its recommendations on how to encourage more high-quality UK equity listings and public offers, along with the government’s response.We are acting on Lord Hill’s recommendations, for instance in our consultation onreforms to the UK’s prospectus regime to make regulation more agile and effective,and facilitate wider participation in the ownership of public companies.
Chapter 2: Align – Enabling the market toalign with UK climate and environmentalgoals
1. The UK made a commitment at COP 26 to become the world’s ﬁrst Net Zero-aligned Financial Centre. Meeting this ambition will better position the UK’s ﬁnancesector to seize the opportunity from the transition to a net zero, nature-positive andresilient economy, in line with the Paris Agreement[footnote 24] and Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework[footnote 25].
2. This chapter sets out actions the UK government will take to achieve thisambition, building on Greening Finance: A Roadmap to Sustainable Investing

(2021), and on stakeholder feedback received in our Call for Evidence. Thisincludes improving the quality and quantity of sustainability-related information anddata provided to the market, supporting the development of related tools andframeworks and using policy levers to shift and scale up the availability of ﬁnancefor these goals. This will ensure we have the world-leading market frameworks inplace to raise ambition on global standards and translate ﬁnancial activity into real-world impact.
Box 6: Call for Evidence feedback – stakeholder views on UK next steps
Ask 1: Give clarity on the UK government’s expectations for the UK ﬁnancesector and the action they should take in response to the global transition toa net zero, resilient and nature positive economy. We address this in section2.1.Ask 2: Implement a regulatory and disclosure framework that ensuresinvestors and consumers receive the information they need from businessesand ﬁnancial ﬁrms, and that new investment tools and market frameworksare robust and protect consumers. We address this in Sections 2.2 – 2.5.Ask 3: Maximise interoperability between the UK’s green ﬁnance regulatoryframework and those of other major ﬁnancial centres and raising globalstandards whilst enabling market participants to operate seamlessly betweenjurisdictions. We address this in section 2.6.
2.1 A pathway towards a UK Net Zero-aligned FinancialCentre
2.1.1 What is a Net Zero-aligned Financial Centre?3. Our aim is for UK ﬁnancial ﬁrms’ activities to be consistent with the pathwaytowards our domestic and global net zero objectives, including our nationallydetermined contribution under the Paris Agreement, and our domestic carbonbudgets. The key components of our strategy towards this pathway include:
UK ﬁnancial institutions having a robust ﬁrm-level transition plan setting out howthey will decarbonise as the UK meets its net zero targetsstrong government oversight of the ﬁnancial sector as a whole to ensure ﬁnancialﬂows shift towards supporting net zero[footnote 26]
4. The creation and implementation of high quality transition plans provides the keyvehicle for driving change, and companies themselves are well placed to designtheir transition pathway in line with their wider objectives and existing strengths. Tosupport companies in their efforts and encourage quality and consistency, theTransition Plan Taskforce (TPT) is developing the gold standard for private sectortransition plans. The government also has a role in overseeing their progress, andensuring it adds up to progress against domestic and global net zero objectives.

5. Transition plans are important for joining up the strong domestic and internationalwork on sustainability disclosures and the private sector leadership on net zerocommitments made in the run up to COP 26. They help ensure these pledges turninto real action by companies that ultimately will drive the transition to net zero.
6. We are clear that there is no pathway to net zero without protecting and restoringnature. In the landmark Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, the UKsigned up to international goals and targets to put nature on a path to recovery by2030. As part of this, we committed to ensuring that large and transnationalcompanies and ﬁnancial institutions regularly monitor and disclose their risk,dependencies and impacts on nature.
7. As we transition to net zero, we will also take action to prepare for the physicalimpacts of the changing climate, seeking to align ﬁnance ﬂows with a climateresilient economy and increase investment in adaptation.
8. The Net Zero-aligned Financial Centre framework sets out how the government’sgreen and sustainable ﬁnance policies work toward bringing about the net zerotransition in the real economy and provide government oversight to ensure theshifting of ﬁnancial ﬂows. The framework brings together public and private sectoraction in 3 related areas:
a. Transparency: We will ensure the right information and data ﬂows from thereal economy to ﬁnancial ﬁrms, and from ﬁnancial services to end investors, toinform stakeholders. This will support ﬁnancial ﬁrms’ own disclosure andinvestors’ capital allocation. See section 2.2 for more detail on Transparency.Key policy levers include Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (see section2.2.1), transition plans (see section 2.2.2), ﬁnancial product labelling (seesection 2.2.5) and support for initiatives seeking to improve global datacoverage and tracking capability (section 2.6.1).b. Tools for transformation: We will support the development of tools andframeworks that all ﬁnancial market participants will need to incorporateinformation into investment decisions and monitor their progress onsustainability so that ﬁnancial markets can act upon the data provided. As partof this, we will continue to promote interoperability with other jurisdictions. Seesection 2.3 for more detail on Tools for transformation. Key policy levers includeour work on benchmarks (see section 2.3.4) and ESG ratings (see section2.3.3).c. Transmission channels: We will use government policy levers to shift andscale up the availability of ﬁnance for the transition to net zero by i) de-riskinggreen investments and lowering their cost of capital, ii) broadening pools ofcapital and the investor base, and iii) enabling investors to inﬂuence corporatepractice. See section 2.4 for more detail on transmission channels. Policiessuch as the UK Infrastructure Bank (see section 3.2.2), Solvency UK (seesection 2.4.1), our Green Gilt programme (see section 2.4.2), and our work oninvestor stewardship (see section 2.4.3) will support delivery of the Net Zero-aligned Financial Centre framework.

9. The Paris Agreement aims to strengthen the response to climate change in avariety of ways, including through making ﬁnancial ﬂows consistent with a pathwaytowards low GHG emissions and climate-resilient development. Our aim is for UKﬁnancial ﬁrms’ activities to be consistent with the pathway towards our domesticand global net zero objectives, and many have already committed to aligning theiractivities with Net Zero through initiatives such as the Glasgow Financial Alliancefor Net Zero (GFANZ) and Race to Zero, championed under the UK’s COP 26Presidency. Sectoral pathways for the UK are being developed in line with the UK’sNet Zero Strategy, and we will continue working to strengthen understanding ofinternational transition pathways, including by drawing on work to enhanceinternational tracking, remove reporting barriers and improve interoperability.
2.1.2 Measuring progress10. Key to ensuring that the UK’s Net Zero-aligned Financial Centre frameworkdelivers the outcomes necessary, will be the development and application ofappropriate key performance indicators (KPIs). These KPIs will help to target ourpolicies and measure their outcomes, focusing not just on sustainable ﬁnanceoutcomes, but also on the impact on the UK’s growth and competitiveness. Weintend to engage widely with stakeholders on our approach to these KPIs with aview to ﬁnalising our framework in 2024.
11. The areas we envisage these KPIs potentially covering include topics such as:the quantity and quality of sustainability reporting and transition plans; consistencyof ﬁnance ﬂows with climate goals; the size of green ﬁnance markets; jobs andskills in green ﬁnance; and the competitiveness of the UK as a global green ﬁnancecentre.

12. The government will regularly assess the effectiveness of our policy within theNet Zero-aligned Financial Centre structure, through periodic monitoring of KPIsand appropriate policy adjustment, ensuring that government is transparent andaccountable for driving the transition of the ﬁnance sector.
2.2 Transparency: Comparable and consistent informationﬂows
13. The bedrock of ﬁnancial markets is information. Market participants needconsistent, comparable data and information to ﬂow from the real economy intotheir decision-making. This allows asset owners to better understand which projectswill have the greatest positive climate impact; it enables ﬁnancial ﬁrms to lend orborrow money based on a timely and accurate assessment of climate and naturerisks; and it empowers companies themselves to better tell their stakeholders howthey will reach their climate and environmental objectives. Ultimately, moreinformation should lead to more accurate pricing in markets.
14. The UK has already taken a number of steps to ensure market participantshave the data they need. This includes: becoming the ﬁrst G20 country to requireTaskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosure-aligned (TCFD) disclosuresacross the economy; setting out a comprehensive approach to disclosure in the2021 ‘Greening Finance: A Roadmap to Sustainable Investing’, and being the ﬁrstgovernment to fund and fully support the creation and progress of the Taskforce onNature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). The UK government is committed tocontinuing on this path, and is creating an effective disclosure framework forsustainability information. We know the importance of getting this right, balancinginvestor needs for information with the burdens of providing that information.
2.2.1 Sustainability Disclosure Requirements
Progress to date15. ‘Greening Finance: A Roadmap to Sustainable Investing’ (2021) set out the UKgovernment’s long-term strategy to ensure investors and consumers are able toaccess the sustainability information they need[footnote 27]. Our plan forSustainability Disclosure Requirements (SDR), a streamlined disclosure frameworkfor sustainability information, is central to this. The SDR framework brings togethernew and existing sustainability reporting requirements for business, the ﬁnancialsector and investment products. This will enable market participants to identifyinvestment opportunities, ensuring that sustainability claims stand up to scrutinyand protect against consumer harms such as ‘greenwashing’.
16. A key aspect of the UK’s disclosure framework has been the requirementsaligned with TCFD recommendations. The TCFD is an industry-led group, set up in2015, tasked with developing a disclosure framework which could apply to anycompany in any geography, supporting them to consider and report on their climaterisks and opportunities in a uniform way.

Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
17. Given the positive market reaction to the framework and subsequent voluntaryreporting, in our 2019 Green Finance Strategy we set an expectation that all listedcompanies and large asset owners should disclose in line with TCFD by 2022. Inaddition, we set up a cross government and regulator taskforce to consider theappropriateness of mandatory disclosure requirements and coordinate thinking.The taskforce ultimately advised that mandatory disclosure requirements should beintroduced to improve the quantity, quality and consistency of reporting, and inNovember 2020 the government set out a commitment to introduce economy-widerequirements by 2025.
18. We have delivered on this commitment, becoming the ﬁrst G20 government todo so:
a. New regulations on 28 October 2021, required listed companies with over500 employees, alongside private companies and Limited Liability Partnerships(LLPs) with more than 500 employees and a turnover of over £500 million todisclose their governance, strategy, risk management and use of metrics andtargets regarding climate risks and opportunities, within their annual StrategicReport. This must include the use of scenario analysis. These newrequirements apply for accounting periods starting on or after 6 April 2022.[footnote 28]
b. As of the end of December 2021, the the FCA introduced climate-relateddisclosure requirements aligned with the TCFD’s recommendations for thefollowing regulated ﬁrms: premium listed companies, issuers of standard listedshares and global depositary receipts, asset managers, life insurers and FCA-regulated pension providers.c. From 1 October 2021, the government introduced requirements relating tooccupational pension schemes reporting in line with the TCFDrecommendations, to improve both the quality and governance and the level ofaction by trustees in identifying, assessing and managing climate risk.[footnote 29]On 1 October 2022 updated requirements were introduced in relation to thecalculation and reporting of a metric which gives the alignment of the scheme’sassets with the goal of limiting the increase in the global average temperature to1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels.[footnote 30]
19. The UK is currently in the ﬁrst full year of TCFD-aligned climate-relateddisclosure requirements cycle. TCFD requirements will be a central part of the SDRframework as well as the foundation for the IFRS Sustainability DisclosureStandards (see Section 2.2.3). This provides UK ﬁrms with a ﬁrm footing as the UKrequirements evolve to take into account IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards.20. Government has announced plans to implement TCFD recommendations incentral government annual reports and accounts, with a 3-year phasedimplementation extending to 2025 to 2026. This will align central governmentclimate-related disclosure with best practice in the private sector, improve climate-related risk reporting, and embed climate change into organisations’ decision-making processes. The UK’s export credit agency, UK Export Finance, and somepublic ﬁnance institutions are already reporting or committed to reporting in line withthe TCFD recommendations.

Box 7: Case study on UK Export Finance TCFD disclosure
In 2021, UK Export Finance made its ﬁrst TCFD disclosure, delivering on acommitment made in the 2019 Green Finance Strategy and becoming the ﬁrstUK government department to do so. The disclosure set out UKEF’s approachto climate change (across TCFD’s 4 key pillars (Governance; Strategy; RiskManagement; and Metrics and Targets) and highlighted key progress inembedding it across the department.
Last year, UK Export Finance published its second TCFD disclosure,signiﬁcantly enhancing its approach:[footnote 31]
Estimating, for the ﬁrst time, UKEF’s ﬁnanced emissions across its fullportfolio, using an approach aligned with industry best practice anddeveloped speciﬁcally for export credit agencies;Setting ambitious quantitative 2030 decarbonisation targets for the oil andgas, and power sectors, which will guide UKEF on its pathway to net zero by2050.Committing to set an emissions intensity-based decarbonisation target for itsaviation sector exposure within 12 months.
Implementing TCFD has allowed UK Export Finance to better identify, assessand manage climate-related risks across all its activities, as well as identifyingactions to support decarbonisation of its portfolio on its path to net zero by2050. This includes actions UK Export Finance can take to support itscustomers’ transitions. It has also enabled UK Export Finance to play aleadership role among export credit agencies globally, encouraging others tofollow the UK’s lead.
21. Building on the experience of the TCFD, the UK government has been one ofthe largest supporters of the global, market-led Taskforce on Nature-relatedFinancial Disclosures (TNFD) – in recognition of the increasingly ﬁnancial materialrisks associated with biodiversity loss. The TNFD has been set up to create a riskmanagement and disclosure framework for organisations to report and act onevolving nature-related risks and opportunities, with the ultimate aim of supportinga shift in global ﬁnancial ﬂows away from nature-negative outcomes and towardsnature-positive outcomes.
22. The TNFD consists of 40 individual Taskforce Members representing ﬁnancialinstitutions, corporates and market service providers with assets undermanagement (AUM) exceeding $20 trillion.[footnote 32] It now has over 900institutions from across sectors and geographies in its TNFD Forum. There arecurrently over 100 pilots being ofﬁcially conducted by the TNFD, with 10 NationalConsultation Groups (NCG) across the world, to facilitate market engagement,capacity building and adoption.

23. We remain committed to implementing SDR. In line with the recommendation ofthe independent Net Zero Review, we will look to ensure close coordination on thisbetween the government and the relevant regulators. We will set out further detailon the implementation of SDR in the summer to reﬂect the rapid development ofinternational standards.
24. SDR should be introduced in a way that complements the UK’s wider legalframework for non-ﬁnancial reporting, gives companies sufﬁcient opportunity toadjust to new requirements and minimises duplication with other forms of corporatereporting. This is why the government is conducting a broader review of the UK’snon-ﬁnancial reporting framework, which will take a fresh look at the wider legallandscape in which sustainability disclosures and other planned reforms will besituated. The review will begin with a call for evidence and aims to ensure that thiswider legal framework delivers decision-useful information in a cost-effective,streamlined, and proportionate manner. We encourage stakeholders to respond tothis when published.
25. In the following sections we set out our plans to implement the componentsof the SDR regime. This will include next steps on:
disclosure of transition plans (see section 2.2.2)IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards produced by the InternationalSustainability Standards Board (see section 2.2.3)supporting companies to understand and report on their GHG emissions, nature-related ﬁnancial risks and impacts, and physical climate risks (see section 2.2.4)fund labels and FCA approach to SDR (see section 2.2.5)
2.2.2 Transition plans
What are transition plans?26. Transition plans typically set out a) high-level targets organisations are using tomitigate climate risk, including greenhouse gas reduction targets, b) interimmilestones, and c) actionable steps the organisation plans to take to hit thosetargets. This is crucial in setting out how organisations will both drive change andadapt as the world moves towards a net zero economy. Many organisations,especially those with public-facing climate and environmental targets, have alreadystarted using transition plans. For example, of the 1,448 UK organizations thatdisclosed through CDP, a global voluntary disclosure platform, in 2022, 404reported having developed a 1.5°C-aligned climate transition plan.[footnote 33]
Work of the Transition Plan Taskforce27. To address the need for a better understanding of best practice within themarket, government launched the Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT), co-chaired by HM Treasury and Aviva, in April 2022. The TPT is expected to publish its DisclosureFramework and Implementation Guidance for transition plans in the summer 2023.

36/131
[Page #36]
14/10/2023, 16:24
Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
28. The Taskforce will continue to develop its ideas, seeking to build consensusand both drawing on and inﬂuencing international disclosure standards. Byestablishing robust expectations for transition plans, the TPT is informing theimplementation of the UK’s SDR. It will also enable investors to exercise moreeffective stewardship, by using consistent and comparable transition plans to betterallocate and oversee capital.
29. In its second phase of work, the TPT will consider in more detail how nature’srecovery, climate adaptation and social impacts can be incorporated into transitionplans. The TPT will also begin work to develop sector-speciﬁc transition planguidance and develop the TPT Sandbox to accelerate new capabilities to supportpreparers and users of transition plans.[footnote 34]
30. Transition plans have the potential to mobilise green and transition ﬁnance at atransformative scale globally, creating new economic opportunities. The TPTintends to raise international ambition for a global baseline standard on transitionplans and has prioritised interoperability by working towards alignment withelements of the draft IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards. The TPT hasproposed to align with ISSB guidance by encouraging company transition plans touse the same reporting boundary as their wider corporate reporting. This approachwould enable integration of international ﬁnancial ﬂows within company transitionreporting. The TPT is also working with initiatives such as GFANZ to align guidanceand support transition planning across the sector.
UK support for transition plans31. Given the important role of transition planning, the UK government committedto moving toward mandatory disclosure of transition plans during our COP26Presidency. The FCA has now introduced and updated rules for assetmanagers/owners and listed companies with comply or explain requirements topublish transition plans.
32. The government commits to consulting on the introduction of requirements forthe UK’s largest companies to disclose their transition plans if they have them. Thiswill complement existing requirements in place from the FCA, and as such willensure parity between listed and private companies, and ensure requirements areconsistent and comparable across the economy. This consultation will take placeonce the TPT has completed its work in autumn/winter 2023. It will look to alignwith the FCA’s existing obligations for transition plans, which require plans to beproduced on a ‘comply or explain’ basis.
33. The government wishes to encourage companies to plan for their transition butdoes not wish to place undue burdens onto companies whose size or scale makesmandatory disclosure unreasonable. Therefore, we will consult on proposals withproportionality in mind and within the context of the UK’s non-ﬁnancial reportingreview, which will consider the thresholds used to determine which companies mustcomply with reporting obligations under the Companies Act 2006. As a result, anyfuture obligations will only apply to the UK’s most economically signiﬁcant entities –the vast majority of companies will not have additional burdens placed on them bythese proposals.

Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
34. The government will also work with the FCA to ensure transition planrequirements are delivered across the ﬁnancial services sector alongsiderequirements across listed and private companies.
35. The government will also take proactive steps to encourage other jurisdictionsto mandate transition plan requirements. This will include encouraging consistencywith the TPT’s guidance, which will go beyond the baseline for transition plans setout under the ISSB. We will advocate for the importance of international alignmentand best practice in transition planning- collaborating with our partners through keyforums such as the G7, G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group (SFWG) and ourleadership of the private ﬁnance workstream at the Coalition of Finance Ministersfor Climate Action.
2.2.3 IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards36. Over the last decade, many voluntary sustainability reporting standards andframeworks have been created in the market, responding to the increased demandfor climate and sustainability information from market participants. Between 2013and 2016, the number of reporting frameworks that focus on sustainability in abroad sense doubled to nearly 400.[footnote 35]
37. Given the global nature of ﬁnancial systems, harmonisation and interoperabilitybetween jurisdictions is a priority for the UK in developing our approach to greeningthe ﬁnancial sector. This can help facilitate growth by reducing unnecessaryregulatory burden for businesses and ﬁnancial service providers working acrossjurisdictions and maximise efﬁcient ﬂow of capital.
38. Recognising the importance of international harmonisation, at COP26 theInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation announced thecreation of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) to develop IFRSSustainability Disclosure Standards, with the objective to set a global baseline forsustainability reporting. The ﬁnal version of the ﬁrst 2 standards – a generalrequirement standard and a climate-related standard – are expected to bepublished in June 2023.
39. At CBD COP15 in December 2022, the ISSB further announced that it wouldincorporate water, biodiversity and ecosystems into its development of futurestandards, drawing on the work of the Task Force for Nature-Related FinancialDisclosures (TNFD) and other relevant initiatives.
40. The UK government, ﬁnancial regulators and many market participants havestrongly welcomed the initiative to create the IFRS Sustainability DisclosureStandards. This builds on the UKs long history of support for the IFRS Foundation’sﬁnancial reporting standards, which are used by the UK and approximately 125other countries.
41. Establishing the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards is a ground-breakingstep which recognises that many businesses and ﬁnancial ﬁrms are global andhave activities that cross borders. Sustainability Disclosure Standards will provide

these organisations with a high-quality reporting framework and ensure investorshave access to globally consistent and comparable information.
42. The UK government will continue to show international leadership in its supportfor the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards. Meeting the recommendation ofthe independent Net Zero Review, we intend to launch a formal assessmentmechanism as soon as the ﬁrst 2 standards are published (expected in June 2023).This assessment will aim to ensure that the standards endorsed by the governmentfor use in the UK are appropriate for UK companies. These standards will providethe basis for future obligations within company law and FCA requirements for listedcompanies, ensuring a single set of standards is applied across the UK regulatoryframework. Further standards will be similarly assessed as they are published.
43. The government remains committed to introducing mandatory reporting againstthe UK endorsed standards, subject to the conclusion of the assessment process.Decisions on incorporating the endorsed standards into company law will be takenalongside future reforms to the UK’s non-ﬁnancial reporting framework, as they aredeveloped within the UK’s Non-Financial Reporting Review. Implementation of FCArequirements for listed companies will be taken forward independently once thestandards are endorsed for use in the UK.
44. To support government in its decision making, the government intends toestablish 2 advisory committees, the ﬁrst of which is expected to be government ledand will have a remit covering matters of public policy. The second committee,which will be supported by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) andindependently chaired, will have a technical focus and - among other things - beresponsible for considering how the standards ﬁt alongside existing reportingrequirements for UK companies in scope. These committees are expected to beestablished by the time the ISSB launches its ﬁrst 2 standards and frameworkdocuments will be published shortly. The government’s aim is for an endorsementdecision to be made within 12 months of the ﬁnal standards being published, but adecision will be made sooner if possible.
45. We would like to thank the ISSB for the excellent progress it has made todevelop its initial standards and encourage its continued work to create a globallyinteroperable baseline on sustainability disclosures. The UK government andﬁnancial regulators, including the FCA and FRC, continue to support these effortson the international stage. The government recognises that for the objectives of aninternational baseline to be met it is important that there is strong global take up ofthe standards, which we will support through our international engagement anddevelopment assistance.
2.2.4 Supporting businesses to understand and report on their greenhousegas emissions, nature-related ﬁnancial risks, dependencies and impacts, andphysical climate risks

46. For most businesses and investors, a key starting point to assessing climaterisks and opportunities, or to setting a transition plan, is developing anunderstanding of energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
47. Disclosure of speciﬁed energy use and GHG emissions by the largest UKbusinesses has been required since 2013. This currently includes, underStreamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR), reporting of scope 1 (directemissions) and scope 2 (indirect emissions), but (except in a few limitedcircumstances) does not include scope 3 emissions (those generated in the valuechain of an organisation). A number of organisations do however include detailedscope 3 disclosures in their reports on a voluntary basis; or have assessed theirscope 3 emissions when setting net zero targets (such as under the Science BasedTargets Initiative) or reporting through voluntary non-governmental disclosuressystems (such as CDP).
48. As scope 3 GHG emissions can account for anywhere between 80-95% of anorganisation’s total footprint[footnote 36], this is a major information gap for investors,preventing them from fully assessing the climate-related risks and opportunities oftheir investments[footnote 37]. However, there is signiﬁcant uncertainty in the marketaround the methodologies used to generate and report scope 3 GHG emissionsdata. With organisations facing increased demand to disclose scope 3 GHGemissions, the UK government wants to explore how it can support Scope 3reporting and will launch a call for evidence to gather stakeholder views.
49. A key barrier to data availability in value chains is the capacity of businesses togenerate and report that data. The UK government is committed to reducing theburden of generating this data for businesses as much as possible. This meanssupporting the data generation and reporting process for small and medium-sizedenterprises who are often an important part of the value chain for larger businessesor ﬁnancial ﬁrms, helping them to decarbonise.
50. To highlight best practice guidance for gathering and reporting environmentaldata, the UK government will test with stakeholders updates to the EnvironmentalReporting Guidelines (ERG), which provides voluntary environmental reportingguidance for UK organisations. Section 3.2.2 provides more information about howwe are supporting small businesses to decarbonise.
Box 8: Measuring and managing small and medium enterprises’ GHGemissions
There are 5.5 million small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the UK,comprising over 99% of businesses and around 50% of total GHG emissionsfrom UK businesses. They are a core part of the UK’s journey to net zero andwe are keen to support SMEs to set meaningful net zero targets and reducetheir GHG emissions. Streamlining and simplifying the data collection processis key to this.
The UK government is working with Bankers for Net Zero, the British BusinessBank and a range of industry stakeholders, to automate SME sustainabilityreporting on a national scale by creating a common data sharing platform for

net zero data sharing – building on both Open Banking and Open Energy. Thiswill aid SME engagement with, and planning for, the transition to net zero. Thisprogramme will remove a major barrier that SMEs face in setting and workingtowards their net zero targets, as measuring, monitoring and managing theirGHG emissions can prove time and resource intensive and thus deter themfrom their goal. It will also help banks manage their own net-zero strategies,including managing risk and unlocking opportunities for access to capital.
Enabling banks to help their SME customers to track GHG emissions, includingscope 3 GHG emissions, will help unlock further access to capital to helpachieve our national net zero goals. Bankers for Net Zero plan to feature thepilot programme of this at COP28.
Nature-related ﬁnancial risks, dependencies and impacts51. The UK government remains committed to supporting the work of the Taskforcefor Nature-Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD).[footnote 38] The TNFD frameworkwill enable investors to make more nature-positive capital allocation decisions. Itwill be designed to be used by businesses and ﬁnancial institutions of differentsizes, across sectors and jurisdictions, in a manner that can inform the globalbaseline on nature related reporting. The UK TNFD NCG provides an awarenessand capacity building platform for institutions across sectors to pilot the variousiterations of the TNFD framework and collectively ﬁnd solutions to implementationchallenges.
52. The UK government will explore how best the ﬁnal TNFD framework, due to bepublished in September 2023, should be incorporated into UK policy and legislativearchitecture, in line with Target 15 of the Global Biodiversity Framework. The TNFDprovides the main method of operationalising Target 15 and the UK governmentwelcomes closer integration with the ISSB to build a global baseline onsustainability reporting.
53. Further, and as announced in September 2022, we are working with the Bankof England, the Green Finance Institute and other partners to quantify moreeffectively the potential UK ﬁnancial exposures from nature loss and degradation.
Box 9: Building on the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and LandUse
COP 26 marked a signiﬁcant moment for global efforts to protect and restoreforests, which are crucial to the functioning of the carbon and water cycle, aswell as climate change mitigation and adaptation.
Over 140 countries – representing 90% of the world’s forests – signed theGlasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use (GLD) and committedto work collectively to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030while delivering sustainable development and promoting an inclusive ruraltransformation.

Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
Recognising the power and necessity of private ﬁnance in protecting forestsand other ecosystems, GLD Action 6 commits countries to facilitate thealignment of ﬁnancial ﬂows with international goals to reverse forest loss anddegradation. We will work with UK ﬁnancial institutions, starting with a series ofgovernment-convened roundtables in 2023, to further tackle deforestation-linked ﬁnance.
Physical climate risks54. Environmental reporting requirements for businesses and the ﬁnancial sectorare becoming stronger, with the implementation of SECR and TCFD, thedevelopment of the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards and the work of theTransition Plan Taskforce. These measures make it easier for investors tounderstand the climate risks associated with their investments and help directﬁnance towards adaptation. But evidence from the annual TCFD status report, andthe FCA and FRC’s reviews of TCFD reporting, suggests that organisations arestruggling with aspects of reporting requirements for physical climate risks.
55. In response to the Climate Change Committee’s report ‘Investment for a well-adapted UK’, we will work with industry partners to improve, and make moreefﬁcient for business, the approach to climate resilience assessment and disclosurethrough the development of adaptation metrics and guidance. This will facilitate amore structured, quantitative and consistent approach to the assessment andmanagement of physical climate risks. We will ensure that the government’s futureclimate-related disclosure guidance includes sufﬁcient information and detail onphysical climate risk to support organisations in disclosing and mitigating this risk.We will champion the development of adaptation metrics within the IFRSSustainability Disclosure Standards.
56. We will scope what support businesses and the ﬁnance sector needs, forexample guidance, training, facilitating collaboration and standardising data sets,and anticipate developing partnerships with the private sector to support delivery.We will announce our approach alongside our adaptation ﬁnance deliverables andaction plan by the end of 2024.
2.2.5 Fund labels and FCA approach to SDR57. The FCA’s proposals on SDR and investment labels[footnote 39] aim to protectconsumers from greenwashing and help them navigate the market and make moreinformed decisions. They also aim to increase transparency on sustainability-related features of products, and how sustainability risks and opportunities arebeing managed by ﬁrms. The FCA’s recent consultation on these proposals invitedinitial views on new sustainability disclosure requirements for asset managers andFCA-regulated asset owners, as well as a new classiﬁcation and labelling systemfor sustainable investment products.
58. Within their proposals on SDR and investment labels, the FCA noted that ataxonomy – such as the UK Green Taxonomy, once developed – could be one wayof demonstrating that assets meet a credible standard of sustainability.

Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
59. The FCA has engaged extensively with industry, including through theirDisclosure and Labels Advisory Group, made up of industry experts and consumerrepresentatives. The FCA will work with government as they ﬁnalise theirproposals, and as they consider impacts on consumers and competition.
2.3 Tools for transformation
60. Companies and investors must have access to certain tools to be able toassess and act on sustainability disclosures, develop and deliver on transitionplans, or to develop new products and services. This includes having access to theright data and analytics as well as the right skills and expertise. As the green andsustainable ﬁnance market has grown, so too has the creation of new ﬁnancialtools - from green bond veriﬁcations to ESG ratings to sustainability linked loansand bonds. The UK government and regulators are currently taking action tosupport the development and robustness of such tools, products and services,including:
the UK Green Taxonomy (see section 2.3.1)data and analytics (see section 2.3.2)ESG data and rating agencies (see section 2.3.3)benchmarks (see section 2.3.4)ﬁnancial advice (see section 2.3.5)education and skills (see section 2.3.6)
2.3.1 A UK Green Taxonomy61. Government is committed to implementing a usable and useful UK GreenTaxonomy. A Green Taxonomy can prove an important tool in enabling the supply ofrelevant and reliable sustainability information into the market, supporting anincrease in ﬁnancing for activities supporting the transition to net zero anddelivering on UK environmental objectives. It can also support efforts to countergreenwashing and improve market integrity.
62. Developing an appropriate taxonomy is complex and we are keen to learn thelessons from taxonomies introduced in other jurisdictions. This will involvedeveloping the building blocks of the UK Green Taxonomy, such as environmentalobjectives and the relevant criteria, and considering whether it is appropriate topursue a ‘Transition Taxonomy’, which was a recommendation of the Net ZeroReview, or include certain transitional activities within one Taxonomy.
63. The government will engage with market participants to drive forward andunderstand how best to design a taxonomy which achieves our objectives, ensuringthat the information generated through a taxonomy is decision-useful to bothinvestors and companies and can be produced in a simpler, proportionate way. Wewill continue to work through the Green Technical Advisory Group (GTAG), buildingon their expert advice to date. We expect to consult on the Taxonomy in Autumn2023.

64. Nuclear energy has an important role in achieving net zero by 2050 as a crucialsource of reliable low carbon energy. Box 10 provides details on the environmentalconsiderations for nuclear energy, including its beneﬁts. (See also the Powerchapter of the Net Zero Growth Plan and chapter 4 of Powering Up Britain - EnergySecurity Plan). The government proposes that nuclear - as a key technology withinour pathways to reach net zero - will be included within the Taxonomy, subject toconsultation.
65. In the longer term, we also maintain the ambition to introduce mandatorycompany disclosures against a future Taxonomy, though we recognise the usabilitychallenges that have been experienced internationally. The government willtherefore introduce a testing period of voluntary disclosures for at least 2 reportingyears before the introduction of mandatory obligations. This is to ensure that afuture Taxonomy provides accessible and reliable information that is useful tomarkets.
66. Government does not wish to place undue burdens onto companies whose sizeor scale makes the disclosure of taxonomy-related information unreasonable.Therefore, we will develop proposals with proportionality in mind.
67. Whilst developing an effective framework that is tailored to the UK market, wewill continue to work with international partners to maximise interoperability andharmonisation, which will be critical in minimising reporting burden, facilitatingcross-border ﬁnancing and maintaining high levels of transparency andenvironmental integrity. In line with GTAG guidance, we will also work withinternational partners to ensure that other efforts to develop national taxonomiesare informed by the UK’s principles and approach.
68. Finally, given the importance of agriculture for our nature and climate changegoals we have created the Land, Nature, and Adapted Systems Advisory Group(LNAS) as a sub-group to the GTAG to advise on sustainable agriculture andﬁsheries. It will also consider the role of infrastructure, including nature-basedinfrastructure, in delivering a resilient economy.
Box 10: Green credentials of UK nuclear energy
Overview of the role of nuclear energy in a net zero, resilient, nature-positive future
Nuclear energy has a key role in achieving the UK’s net zero objectives, byproviding clean and non-weather dependent power to complementintermittent renewable energy sources.The government proposes that nuclear - as a key technology within ourpathways to reach net zero - will be included within the UK’s GreenTaxonomy, subject to consultation.Over the last 60 years, nuclear power plant designs have increasedefﬁciency and safety and decreased the amount of waste produced. TheHinkley Point C power plant, currently under construction, will save 9 milliontonnes of CO2 per year.[footnote 40] EDF analysis indicates this would be

equivalent to taking nearly 4 million cars off the road annually.[footnote 41]Nuclear provided the second largest share of low carbon electricitygeneration in the UK in 2021, at around 27%.[footnote 42]The 2022 UNECE Integrated Life-cycle Assessment of Electricity Sourcesevaluated the environmental impacts of electricity generation technologies.The assessment found that most life cycle impact indicators for nuclearenergy were low – in many cases lower than for renewables.[footnote 43]Impact indicators where nuclear energy had a higher potential impact thanrenewables were water use and ionising radiation, which the UK effectivelymanages through regulation.In the UK, nuclear energy is subject to a robust and independent regulatoryregime, which ensures UK nuclear power plants are appropriately sited tocope with the water usage required, and that measures are in place tomitigate the impact on people and the environment. UK regulations alsoensure control and mitigation measures are used to maximise the safety ofnuclear facilities and ensure radiation exposure is as low as reasonablypracticable and under regulatory limits. Radiation doses in the UK from thenuclear industry are well below the regulatory limits, including for populationsnear nuclear facilities. Less than 0.01% of the UK’s average annual radiationexposure came from the discharges of the UK’s civil nuclear industry.[footnote44] (See also the Power chapter of the Net Zero Growth Plan and chapter 4of Powering Up Britain - Energy Security Plan).

2.3.2 Data and analytics69. In addition to supporting companies to report their climate change and naturerelated ﬁnancial risks, the UK is also pioneering breakthrough technologies andinvesting in world class data and analytics. In the 2019 Green Finance Strategy, theUK government launched the £10 million Climate and Environmental RiskAnalytics for Resilient Finance programme through UKRI. The resulting UKCentre for Greening Finance & Investment (CGFI), a research consortium led bythe University of Oxford and funded by UKRI, was established in 2021 to acceleratethe adoption and use of climate and environmental data and analytics by ﬁnancial

Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
institutions, enabling the ﬁnance sector to support the delivery of a low carboneconomy and the recovery and restoration of our natural environments.
70. CGFI acts as a platform to connect wider UK science and innovation withﬁnancial institutions, providing a route by which the latest climate andenvironmental science is made accessible, commercialised, and exported globally,placing the UK as global hub for climate and environmental analytics for ﬁnancialinstitutions. It undertakes applied research, hosts open tools and datasets, providesexpertise to industry and policymakers and supports commercial innovation. Focusareas include physical and transition climate issues, nature and litigation.
71. CGFI will now broaden its research scope and promote best practice, developguidance and standards through its innovation hubs in Leeds and London. It willexpand its support to all parts of the UK green ﬁnance ecosystem through sectorspeciﬁc workshops and prototyping, capacity building and student placementprogrammes, stimulating commercial innovation, and more. As mentioned inChapter 1, the University of Oxford, together with the CGFI, is developing a newTransition Finance Centre of Excellence, which will provide best practice data andanalytics on aspects of transition ﬁnance. CGFI is also stepping up its role as atranslation centre and convening hub for the science and ﬁnance communities, toaccelerate comprehension of climate and environmental issues and adoption ofthese insights into ﬁnancial decision-making.
Box 11: Supporting data needed for nature markets
Well-functioning nature markets will rely on good quality data and the UKgovernment, alongside public institutions, are acting to support this:
Our Natural Capital and Ecosystem Assessment (NCEA) programme is ascience innovation and transformation programme, which spans land andwater environments and has been set up to collect data on the extent,condition and change over time of England’s ecosystems and natural capital,and the beneﬁts to society.[footnote 46] The programme is further developingtools and guidance to support the application of this evidence in decisionmaking.The TNFD’s Nature-related Data Catalyst brings together a range of actorsfrom across the nature-related data landscape to recommend ways toaccelerate the development of nature-related data, analytics and tools.[footnote 47]
UKRI has invested in research and innovation programmes that willstrengthen and accelerate embedding the value of biodiversity into decisionmaking in the ﬁnance and business sectors, including UKRI’s £7 millionIntegrating Biodiversity and Finance for a Nature Positive Future (NPF)programme.[footnote 48] This will develop the solutions needed to embed thevalues of biodiversity into ﬁnancial decision making. This investment will builda national multi-stakeholder community that can drive the development ofknowledge, tools and skills to incorporate biodiversity-related risks andopportunities into planning, reporting and investment decisions for theﬁnance and business sectors.

As part of the National Environment Research Council (NERC)’s £40 millionChanging the Environment programme,[footnote 49] the University ofExeter’s £10 million project ‘Renewing biodiversity through a people-in-nature approach’ (RENEW) with the National Trust will develop solutions forthe renewal of biodiversity.[footnote 50] This will include developing new toolsand standards for embedding biodiversity renewal in ﬁnance and businessactivities and enable better biodiversity decision-making.
2.3.3 ESG ratings72. ESG ratings are becoming increasingly important products for investors tryingto assess the environmental performance of a company. The UK is a leader in theESG-related services market– including ESG ratings, data, and veriﬁcationproducts. This market has grown rapidly in the past few years, and is projected toexceed $34 trillion globally by 2026[footnote 51]. Half of all global professionallymanaged assets are projected to include ESG considerations by 2024.[footnote 52]Considering their growing importance, the government wants to ensuretransparency and good market conduct by the providers of these products in theUK.
73. Whilst recognising that ESG investment decisions are a matter for the markets,the government believes it is important that the ESG agenda is not side-tracked bypolitical activism or political agendas. Government regulation should also ensurethat it is consistent with the approach taken across government. For example, thegovernment believes that continued private investment in the UK defence industryand its NATO allies is essential to protect the UK national interest, the UK economyand broader environmental and social goals.
74. As part of the Edinburgh Reforms, the Chancellor announced that governmentwould consult on the regulation of ESG ratings providers. Alongside this Strategy, HM Treasury has also published a consultation on Future ﬁnancial servicesregulatory regime for Environmental Social and Governance ‘ESG’ ratingsproviders.[footnote 53] This seeks views on whether ESG ratings providers should bebrought into the FCA’s regulatory perimeter and on how this could be done.
75. Government has also joined the industry-led ESG Data and Ratings WorkingGroup, which was convened to develop a voluntary code of conduct for these ﬁrms,as an observer.
2.3.4 Benchmarks76. The UK government recognises that benchmarks and indices play a role in theallocation of capital towards green and sustainable investment. The UK’s regulatoryregime for benchmarks already makes provision for ESG benchmarks[footnote 54]. Itsets out requirements for voluntary ESG labels (UK Climate Transition Benchmarksand UK Paris-aligned Benchmarks) and requires all providers of benchmarks todisclose sustainability metrics or declare that they do not have a sustainabilityobjective. This helps consumers verify the green credentials of benchmarks with asustainability objective.

Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
77. Wider regulatory and government initiatives, including the UK Green Taxonomyand investment fund labelling proposals, as well as other tools set out in section2.2.2 in this Green Finance Strategy update, are also likely to have an impact onthe provision of benchmarks in the UK.
78. The UK government will decide on the necessity of further reforms to theregulatory regime for benchmarks after the implementation of the other measuresin this Strategy. In the meantime, the FCA will continue to use existing regulatoryand supervisory levers to ensure that UK benchmarks are produced robustly andwith due transparency.
2.3.5 Financial advice79. As the FCA outlined in its recent SDR and investment labels consultation, it isexploring how to introduce rules for ﬁnancial advisers aimed at conﬁrming that theyshould take sustainability matters into account in their investment advice andunderstand investors’ preferences on sustainability to ensure their advice issuitable.
2.3.6 Education and skills80. Announced in the 2019 Green Finance Strategy and launched in June 2020,the Green Finance Education Charter (GFEC) is a world ﬁrst. The Charter aims tobuild the knowledge and skills of ﬁnance professionals, and the capacity andcapabilities of the ﬁnance sector, to support UK and international net zero andsustainability targets.
81. Charter signatories are leading professional bodies in the ﬁnance sector. Mostare based in the UK and all operate on a global basis. In total, Charter signatorieseducate, train and represent approximately 1 million ﬁnance professionals andreach many more though their public engagement and thought-leadership activities.The GFEC website provides more information on the work that Charter signatorieshave done.[footnote 55]
82. Following a successful period of delivery since 2020[footnote 56], the GFEC willbe re-launched alongside this Strategy as the Sustainable Finance EducationCharter (SFEC). This reﬂects the need for professional bodies and professionals toaddress wider issues of biodiversity loss and nature-based ﬁnance, transitionplanning, and ensuring an economically and socially inclusive transition in supportof the UK’s net zero objectives. The SFEC will also expand its remit to:
attract and work with a wider set of UK professions that play key supporting rolesin aligning ﬁnance and sustainabilityhelp Charter members and others expand the scope of professionaldevelopment programmes to encompass nature-based ﬁnance and otheremerging areas requiring ﬁnance professionals to develop their knowledge andskillswork with counterparts in other jurisdictions to promote and replicate thesuccessful Charter model abroad

2.4 Transmission channels
83. Transmission channels are the link between projects and sectors that will havean impact on the transition, and the scale of ﬁnance available.[footnote 57] Asigniﬁcant volume of capital is under management by those looking to integratetheir investment strategies with net zero, nature positive, climate resilient projects.The UK government’s introduction of Solvency UK and regulatory changes tobroaden the investment opportunities of deﬁned contribution pension schemesmean that there is more opportunity for those managing these assets to put theminto green long-term productive assets.
84. The UK government will continue to explore the actions it can take to enablekey transmission channels for ﬁnancing aligned to a net zero, resilient and naturepositive economy:
a. Cost of capital – developing mechanisms to lower the ﬁnancing costsbusinesses face when seeking to fund capital expenditure for activities alignedwith the transition. Chapter 3 (Invest) of this Strategy sets out the UKgovernment’s strategy to strategically mobilise private sector investment intothese areas using a variety of interventions that will help de-risk investments,enabling businesses in these sectors to beneﬁt from a lower cost of capital, andsupport growth.b. Access to liquidity – improving the ease and speed at which businessescan access capital, and investors can deploy it, by both broadening the investorbase and attracting new market entrants looking to align with with new marketentrants looking to align with the transition to a net zero, resilient and naturepositive economy.c. Investor Stewardship – using the inﬂuence that investors have via corporategovernance, including shareholder engagement, which can persuade and helpguide businesses to take action. This ultimately can support investors togenerate long-term value in their investments.
2.4.1 Unlocking long term capital to improve access to liquidity for greeninvestment85. The insurance industry has an important role to play in supporting thetransition to net zero. It does this through the investments it will make in projectsand companies that target sustainable business models, the broad range ofinsurance products it provides that support adaptation to the impacts of climatechange, and through the underwriting of key risks in the project developmentprocess. The Association of British Insurers have highlighted that their membershave the capacity to support up to 1/3 of the total investment needed by 2035, inline with our net zero pathway.[footnote 58] On the underwriting side, the products theindustry develops that mitigate risk for companies, investors, and consumers cansigniﬁcantly speed up the pace of deployment, particularly for nascent technologiesand business models.
86. At the Autumn Statement 2022 we set out our package of reforms for SolvencyII, the retained EU regime for the prudential regulation of insurance. These set out
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-ﬁnance-strategy/mobilising-green-investment-2023-green-ﬁnance-strategy
49/131
[Page #49]
14/10/2023, 16:24
Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
plans to move to a new regime, tailored to the unique features of this country’sinsurance market: Solvency UK. Reforms will provide incentives for insurers toincrease investment in long-term productive assets, including innovative greenassets and renewable energy infrastructure. A B I predict that Solvency UK createsthe potential for over £100 billion of productive investments from insurers in thenext 10 years, all while maintaining high standards of policyholder protection.[footnote 59] We will begin to implement these reforms in the coming months and willcontinue to work closely with industry and the regulator to do so.
87. Similarly, Deﬁned Contribution (DC) pension schemes are ideal vehicles forinvesting in illiquid assets, such as investments in green projects, that have thepotential to deliver longer term sustainable positive returns which are key tosuccessful savers’ retirement outcomes. Since 2019, the government has beenencouraging D C pension schemes to broaden their investment approaches toensure they are considering as diverse a range of assets as possible for theﬁnancial beneﬁt of members.
88. For the pensions sector, we have published ‘Enabling Investment in ProductiveFinance’ (2021) and the consultation on ‘Broadening the investment opportunitiesof deﬁned contribution pension schemes’ (2022). These set out the UKgovernment’s intention to enable trustees of deﬁned contribution pension schemesto exclude performance-based fees (paid when a fund manager exceeds pre-determined performance targets) from their charge cap calculations, where this is inthe best interests of their members. Following a positive response from theindustry, amended regulations will be brought into force as early as April 2023,subject to Parliamentary approval.
89. At the Spring Budget 2023 we announced a new Long-term Investment forTechnology and Science (LIFTS) initiative, spurring the creation of new vehicles forinvestment into science and tech companies, tailored to the needs of UK deﬁnedcontribution pension schemes which will provide a key stimulus for industry tocreate the structures needed to mobilise DC scheme investment into our mostcutting-edge companies. At Budget, the government launched the request forfeedback on the design of the competition. We will also shortly come forward with aconsultation on the accelerated transfer of the £364 billion Local GovernmentPension Scheme assets into pools to support increased investment in innovativecompanies and other productive assets, leading by example.
2.4.2 Green bonds90. There is signiﬁcant demand from investors for liquid green debt securities, andit is expected that the ongoing Green Financing Programme (Green Gilt) will helpcatalyse further growth of the corporate green bond market in the UK.
UK Green Financing Programme (Green Gilt)91. The UK’s Green Financing Programme is a key pillar of the UK government’sgreen ﬁnance agenda. The Green Financing Programme has raised more than £26billion from the sale of green gilts and NS&I’s retail Green Savings Bonds sincetheir launch in 2021. These ﬁnancing products raise money to fund projects with

clearly deﬁned climate or environmental beneﬁts. The Green Financing Framework,published in June 2021, sets out how funds raised by the Programme help toﬁnance government expenditures that tackle climate change, biodiversity loss andother urgent environmental challenges, while creating green jobs across the UK.
92. The inaugural green gilt issue in September 2021 broke a number of records. Atthe time, it was the largest inaugural green issuance by any sovereign andattracted the largest number of investor accounts (including new investors to the giltmarket) and volume of orders for a gilt syndication executed by the UK DebtManagement Ofﬁce.
93. NS&I’s retail Green Savings Bonds (GSB) went on sale to UK savers inOctober 2021. The GSB allow UK savers to contribute to the UK’s net zero targetand other environmental challenges. As of February 2023, NS&I had raised £0.5billion from the GSB in the 2022 to 2023 ﬁnancial year and £0.8 billion since theinitial October 2021 launch.[footnote 60]
94. The UK government has committed to transparency for investors in the GreenFinancing Programme. We published our ﬁrst annual allocation report in September2022, detailing the green spending programmes to which the proceeds raised havebeen allocated. It details how the Green Financing Programme is already usingprivate capital to ﬁnance government schemes that are protecting property andinfrastructure from the effects of climate change, stimulating markets for low-carbontechnologies, investing in the natural environment, and supporting green jobsacross the UK.
95. We have also committed to publishing an impact report on a regular basis,detailing the environmental impacts and any social co-beneﬁts resulting from theexpenditures (the ﬁrst to do so among major sovereign issuers). Impact reports willbe published at least biennially, with the ﬁrst expected by September 2023.
2.4.3 Investor stewardship96. As the providers and allocators of capital, the UK’s pensions, insurance andinvestment sectors – namely asset owners, asset managers, and the serviceproviders that support them – can use their rights and inﬂuence to drive changewithin the businesses in which they invest. Doing so as part of broader marketalliances can amplify this effect, sending clear signals to corporates and inﬂuencingtheir behaviour. The UK government and regulators are working hard to ensure thatthe UK’s pensions, insurance and investment sectors can meet the expectations onstewardship that the government set out in the 2021 Greening Finance Roadmap.
97. Effective stewardship is crucial to the successful management of risks,opportunities and impacts presented by climate and environmental change. TheFinancial Reporting Council’s (FRC’s) world-leading UK Stewardship Code[footnote61] deﬁnes stewardship as “the responsible allocation, management and oversightof capital to create long-term value for clients and beneﬁciaries leading tosustainable beneﬁts for the economy, the environment and society”. In 2023,signatories to this Code grew to 254, representing £46.4 trillion AUM (up from 235signatories and £40.7 trillion AUM in 2022). Research published by the FRC in July

Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
2022 found strong evidence of material changes of practice following the Code’srevision in 2020.
98. A particular priority is improving information ﬂows to create a comprehensivedisclosure environment, thereby ensuring that decision-useful information andmetrics ﬂow into and out of the system. This will ensure that stewardship can beboth efﬁciently implemented and transparently assessed.
99. Therefore, in Q4 2023, the FRC – working with the FCA, Department for Workand Pensions (DWP) and The Pensions Regulator – will review the regulatoryframework for effective stewardship, including the operation of the StewardshipCode. The review will assess whether the Stewardship Code is creating a marketfor effective stewardship and the need for any further regulation in this area. Thereview will consider:
ways to evaluate and communicate the efﬁcacy of stewardship activity andoutcomesthe need for a common language for stewardship, for example, deﬁningengagement;the role of systemic stewardship in supporting the achievement of positivesustainability outcomesways to align expectations, and reporting that is proportionate and not duplicativeevolving expectations for stewardship in asset classes other than listed equity
100. Ahead of this review, we will begin to engage with stakeholders and seekevidence. Depending on the evidence we receive and the outcome of the review,further action to ensure the effectiveness of the stewardship regulatory frameworkmay be necessary.
101. The UK government recognises the key role of pension scheme trusteesespecially, as there are over £3 trillion[footnote 62] in UK pension investments, butalso that climate change impacts, and actions that governments globally take totackle it, present a ﬁnancial risk/opportunity for pensions. The regulations we’vealready introduced require relevant trustees to measure and report on theirinvestment portfolio’s alignment with the Paris Agreement, together with existingclimate governance and disclosure requirements. This will help inform trustees’investment decisions, stewardship and voting.
102. The Law Commission’s 2014 report suggested that ﬁduciary duty means thatnon-ﬁnancial factors can be taken into account if the 2-stage test is met:
trustees should have good reason to think the scheme members would share theconcernthe decision should not involve a risk of signiﬁcant ﬁnancial detriment to the fund
103. We recognise trustees would like to know what latitude they have and inDWP’s Stewardship Guidance, introduced in 2022, the UK government stated thattrustees may want to consider both ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial matters in theirstewardship activities. We acknowledge decisions around investing and systemicrisks are complicated and that trustees would like further information and clarity on

their ﬁduciary duty in the context of the transition to net zero. To address this, weare taking the following steps:
a. DWP will examine the extent to which their Guidance is being followed in late2023.b. This will be complemented by a working group of the Financial Markets andLaw Committee (FMLC) where participants, including DWP, will consider theissues around ﬁduciary duty and what further action is needed.c. We will be holding a series of roundtables later this year to engage withinterested stakeholders on how we can continue to clarify ﬁduciary duty.
2.5 Working with regulators
104. UK regulators have an important role to play, including as active members ofstandard setting organisations and partnerships, to support the ﬁnancial systemshift necessary to achieve climate and sustainability goals. Key regulatory bodieswe consider in this space are the Bank of England, the Environment Agency, theFinancial Conduct Authority, the Financial Reporting Council and The PensionsRegulator (‘the regulators’).
105. Box 12 below sets out the commitment made by regulators in the context ofthis Strategy. The regulators will also share insights and seek opportunities morewidely, supporting the priorities of the Green Finance Strategy and helping to driveclear and consistent disclosure and reporting of ﬁnancially material non-ﬁnancialrisks. Figure 4 below summarises the regulators’ remit, current work and futureactions related to climate and sustainability.
Box 12: Commitment from green ﬁnance regulators
Green ﬁnance regulators will identify shared priorities for environmental andﬁnancial regulators and explore options for closer working ties to deliver sharedobjectives, establishing a working group within the existing Sustainable FinanceRegulators group to explore opportunities. Areas to be considered by the groupmay include, but not be limited to, a review of regulatory priorities onenvironmental ﬁnance and how support can be leveraged across the group,intelligence gathering on greenwashing and other ESG risks bringing togetherﬁnancial and real-economy regulators, and coordination of collective views andresponses to international consultations. The group will share insights and seekopportunities more widely, supporting the priorities of the Green FinanceStrategy and helping to drive clear and consistent disclosure and reporting ofﬁnancially material non-ﬁnancial risks.
Figure 4: Overview of remit, work and future actions by regulators
Bank of England
The Bank of England’s mission is to promote the good of the people of the UKby maintaining monetary and ﬁnancial stability. Climate change is relevant to

Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
the Bank’s mission as the physical effects of climate change and the transitionto net-zero create ﬁnancial risks and economic consequences. These risks andconsequences can affect the safety and soundness of the ﬁrms that the Bankregulates, the stability of the wider ﬁnancial system, and the economic outlook.

protecting member beneﬁts, reducing calls on the pension protection fund(PPF), and promoting good scheme administration.
Non-exhaustive examples of recent activity and future work:
Set expectations concerning how climate change should be considered andmanaged by trustees of occupational pension schemes.Produced guidance for trustees required to comply with new duties under thegovernance and reporting of climate change risk regulations.Collaborated with TPT to develop a transition plan disclosure framework andimplementation guidance for consultation.Sits on the industry’s VRG, to support trustee engagement and stewardshipon proxy voting by fund managers and Taskforce on Social Factors, toexplore how social risks and opportunities can be applied by pension schemetrustees, industry, and policymakers.It will publish its modular code of practice, in 2023, which will include newmodules on climate change and stewardship.It will publish a thematic review of TCFD-style reports produced by schemesin scope of governance and climate-risk reporting regulations.It will also run a regulatory initiative in 2023 to check compliance with broaderESG and climate change reporting, which must be included in the scheme’sStatement of Investment Principles and Implementation Statements.
2.6 Working with international partners
106. The twin crises of climate change and biodiversity loss transcend nationalboundaries. Rewiring the ﬁnancial system to manage their risks, while creating theconditions for ﬁnance to ﬂow into net zero, resilient and nature positiveinvestments, requires collaboration at the same scale.
107. The UK has helped lay the groundwork for global action to green ﬁnancialsystems by supporting key principles in international agreements. Article 2.1c ofthe Paris Agreement committed signatories to the goal of making “ﬁnance ﬂowsconsistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development”, and Target 14 of the Global Biodiversity Frameworkcommits signatories to align all relevant public and private activities and ﬁnancialﬂows with its goals and targets. The measures in this chapter will build on the UK’sleadership on green ﬁnance to catalyse global progress towards these goals.
108. To ensure that international processes pay sufﬁcient attention to these criticaldrivers of the global transition, the UK will champion the importance of these goals,in particular seeking greater recognition of Article 2.1c through the upcomingGlobal Stocktake and the Sharm-el Sheikh Dialogue agreed at COP 27, andworking towards a new global ﬁnancial goal to replace the $100 billion goal, whichbetter reﬂects the important role of efforts to align the global ﬁnancial system inmeeting the needs of developing countries. This will be coupled with efforts throughkey fora such as the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group (SFWG), to
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-ﬁnance-strategy/mobilising-green-investment-2023-green-ﬁnance-strategy
57/131

14/10/2023, 16:24
Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
ensure build consensus and coherence around actions to build a globally aligned,interoperable ﬁnancial system.
109. Many of the actions set out throughout this strategy to align the UK ﬁnancialsector, will accelerate the global alignment of ﬁnancial ﬂows and help increaseopportunities for green investment in overseas markets, such as through ﬁrm-levelclimate risk disclosure and transition planning. This includes support for emergingmarkets and developing economies (EMDEs) where green investment needs arehighest and where the development of high-integrity approaches to transitionﬁnancing and efforts to build capability will be critical in avoiding capital ﬂight.Building on these actions, we will seek to accelerate progress by:
a. Championing action to align the global ﬁnancial system – using ourvoice in international fora to advocate for equivalent ambition from othercountries, emphasising the importance of interoperability.b. Driving alignment of development ﬁnance – aligning the UK’sdevelopment assistance and international ﬁnance levers with climate andnature goals, and using our voice in international ﬁnancial institutions toencourage them to do the same.c. Building partnerships with EMDEs – sharing our learning and working withour partners to enhance capability and develop the building blocks for unlockinggreen investment.
2.6.1 Championing action to align the global ﬁnancial system110. Since the ﬁrst Green Finance Strategy the UK has catalysed ambitiousglobal action to align the global ﬁnancial system. This included prioritising ﬁnancethrough our COP 26 presidency, which saw the launch of the InternationalSustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for NetZero (GFANZ); and elevating the importance of climate risk disclosure through ourG7 presidency, which brokered unprecedented agreement between G7 FinanceMinisters and Central Bank Governors to move towards mandatory ﬁnancialdisclosures based on the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures(TCFD) framework.
111. To achieve a globally aligned ﬁnancial system which is coherent andinteroperable, our efforts need to be met by equal ambition by our internationalpartners. To support this, the UK government will continue using its voice ininternational forums – including the G7, G20, Financial Stability Board (FSB),Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action, UN Framework Convention onClimate Change (UNFCCC) and UN Convention on Biological Diversity (UNCBD) –to advocate for broadening and deepening coverage of green ﬁnance policyframeworks. In particular, we will call for greater global action on mandatorysustainability disclosures, transition planning requirements, data availabilityand science-based green taxonomies.
112. Stakeholders responding to the Call for Evidence highlighted interoperabilityas a key priority for UK regulatory and policy interventions. We will aim to avoidthe proliferation of different standards and reporting frameworks and instead

Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
promote high integrity, common baselines and principles. We welcome theharmonising and coordinating role of the FSB, in addition to the work of individualbodies, such as the ISSB, and the TPT’s efforts to develop a gold standard fortransition plans. We will use international forums to build consensus in these areas,including the International Platform on Sustainable Finance, the Coalition ofFinance Ministers for Climate Action, and through both the G7 and G20, includingdedicated technical working groups such as the SFWG.
113. In particular, the government is working in 3 key areas to driveinteroperability in global action to align ﬁnance with climate and nature goals:
a. Assessing the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards for use in the UKand supporting the adoption of equivalent standards by other jurisdictions (seesection 2.2.3);b. Supporting the work of the TPT in creating a global gold standard fortransition plan disclosures aligned with IFRS Sustainability DisclosureStandards, which we intend to promote as a basis for other jurisdictions to use(see section 2.2.2), and;c. Encouraging the development of a science-based global baseline ontaxonomies- considering the Green Taxonomy Advisory Grouprecommendations and strengthening our engagement in the InternationalPlatform for Sustainable Finance (see section 2.3.1).
114. The FSB plays a central role in coordinating initiatives by global ﬁnancialauthorities and standard setting bodies to address climate-related ﬁnancial risksthrough its Climate Roadmap. We welcome the FSB’s work to date on disclosures,data, vulnerabilities, and regulatory practices. The FSB has played a key role indriving the work of the TCFD and embedding IFRS Sustainability DisclosureStandards within the G20’s reform agenda. Over the coming year, the UKgovernment will support the TPT to consider aligning with the FSB’s 2023regulatory work on transition planning, and we will encourage implementation oftransition plans by other jurisdictions.
115. The lack of capability to track international ﬁnancial ﬂows and widespread datagaps on climate ﬁnance remains a critical barrier for ﬁnancial institutions tointegrate climate related risk into their decision making and deliver their climate andnature targets. In addition to the UK’s Landscape of Climate Finance work (seesection 3.1.3), the UK is working with the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) to mapthe mobilisation of ﬁnance ﬂows through the UK to EMDEs, including tounderstand data gaps and how tracking and reporting of international ﬂows couldbe improved. Moreover, Financial Services Deepening Africa also worked with CPIto launch a Landscape of Climate Finance in Africa report at COP27. These effortswill contribute to measuring progress against Article 2.1c of the Paris Agreementand Target 15 of the GBF, and will enhance our understanding of how UK activitiesare inﬂuencing global ﬁnance ﬂows.
116. The government will also continue working to improve the supply, qualityand comparability of climate and nature related ﬁnancial data, globally. Thiswill support raising the quality of disclosures, investment tracking and supportinvestor conﬁdence- complementing our work on reporting of Scope 3 GHG

emissions in section 2.2.4. The UK welcomes the work of the FSB ClimateVulnerabilities Data Group in addressing data gaps and maximising data ﬂowsbetween ﬁnancial authorities. Our own UK PACT programme has supported arange of global projects on this issue, such as the Colombian Climate AssetDisclosure Initiative (CCADI) which is working to promote the inclusion of climatechange risks into investment decisions by ﬁnancial actors and providingrecommendations to the Colombian government regarding the greening of theirﬁnancial system. We will also focus future work on areas where investment is mostlacking, but data gaps remain, such as internal investment within countries andcompanies, and towards adaptation.
117. Leveraging our efforts to improve investment tracking and data availability, theUK will support international activity to raise the integrity of climate and naturealignment commitments, ensuring a level playing ﬁeld and protecting againstgreenwashing. To this end, we welcome the work of the UN Secretary General’sHigh-Level Expert Group on Net-Zero Commitments and support the Race toZero’s adoption of robust targets and mitigating actions. We will continue tocollaborate with other key initiatives developing science-based methodologies topromote integrity and coherence.
118. To maximise our role in accelerating change, the UK is supporting coalitionsthat are translating commitments into actions across public and private ﬁnancialtransitions. For example, the UK is the co-chair of the Powering Past CoalAlliance (PPCA), an alliance of governments, subnational governments andprivate sector organisations committed to phasing out unabated coal power by2030 in the EU and OECD, and 2040 in the rest of the world. Since its launch in2017, the PPCA has grown substantially, with more than $17 trillion USD AUM nowcommitted via PPCA membership. As part of this we are working with ﬁnancialinstitutions to refresh the PPCA’s Finance Principles, which translate the aim ofglobal unabated coal power phase-out into tangible actions they can take. We areworking to ensure these principles are fully integrated through individual ﬁrms’lending, investments, reporting and engagement policies, and working through thePPCA and its partners to address challenges around insufﬁcient coal asset data.
119. We will also champion high standards in working with international partners.For instance, UK Export Finance (UKEF) will continue to work with its internationalcounterparts and customers to set stretching climate goals and boost clean growthand climate adaptation investments. UKEF will work with partners to modernise theterms and standards that OECD Export Credit Agencies apply, raising the bar forpublic export ﬁnance internationally. They will also continue to championinternationally the COP 26 Presidency statement on aligning international publicﬁnance with the clean energy transition.
Box 13: Role of the Bank of England in greening the global ﬁnancialsystem
The UK government works closely with the Bank in our efforts to green theglobal ﬁnancial system, including through our joint UK seat at the G20 SFWGand G7 Finance Track. They are a leading member of the global organisations

seeking to analyse the ﬁnancial risks from climate change and potentialmitigations. As the Bank advances its climate agenda it will continue to workclosely with the international community to ensure outcomes are aligned to itsobjectives, including through the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision(BCBS), International Association of Insurance Supervisors, Financial StabilityBoard (FSB), Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), G7 and G20.Examples of speciﬁc work are as follows:
supporting a holistic approach to assessing, measuring and mitigatingclimate-related ﬁnancial risks through the BCBS’s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Risks (TFCR)advocating rapid and robust development and implementation of IFRSSustainability Disclosure Standardscontributing to FSB workstream outputs on topics such as supervisory andregulatory approaches to climate change, disclosures, scenario analysis,ﬁnancial stability risk monitoring, and macroprudential work. In 2023, theBank will work with international standard-setting bodies to understand therole of transition plans in prudential risk management and ﬁnancial stabilitychairing the NGFS workstream on monetary policy, and previously chairingthe workstream focused on scenario design and analysiscontributing to the work of the Sustainable Insurance Forum, having co-founded it in 2016 and held the chair from 2020 to 2022providing training through the Centre for Central Banking Studies
2.6.2 Driving alignment of development ﬁnance120. We recognise that it is critical for the UK to assist emerging markets anddeveloping economies (EMDEs) to align ﬁnance ﬂows with climate andenvironmental goals. In the ﬁrst instance, that means ensuring that the support thatwe provide to these countries is consistent with these goals. That is why wecommitted in the ﬁrst Green Finance Strategy to align all UK OfﬁcialDevelopment Assistance (ODA) with the Paris Agreement, making us the ﬁrstcountry in the world to do so. This was reiterated in the International DevelopmentStrategy (IDS) with a timebound milestone, committing to ensure all new bilateralUK ODA aligns with the Paris Agreement in 2023. The FCDO (major ODA spendingdepartment), has embedded this through the creation of a new rule in theirProgramme Operating Framework speciﬁc to Paris Alignment. We also committedin the IDS to take steps to ensure that bilateral ODA becomes ‘nature positive’,aligning with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) and theinternational goal to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030.
121. Since the 2019 commitment to align UK ODA with the Paris Agreement, theUK in 2021 ended the provision of new direct ﬁnancial or promotional supportfor the fossil fuel energy sector overseas other than in limited circumstances.This includes UK Export Finance with respect to the ﬁnancial support thegovernment provides for UK exports.

122. The UK is also embedding Paris Agreement objectives in British InternationalInvestment (BII), the UK’s development ﬁnance institution, which committed to alignits activities and investment portfolio with the Paris Agreement. BII launched aClimate Strategy in 2020, which set out 3 building blocks for its Paris alignmentapproach: achieving net zero GHG emissions by 2050, ensuring a just transition,and supporting adaptation and resilience. B I I pursues a dual approach to net zerowhich includes assessing new investments for alignment with their host country’spathway to net zero, as well as steering the wider investment portfolio to align witha 1.5 C pathway.
123. Using our shareholdings in multilateral development banks (MDBs), the UKwill continue working beyond our bilateral investment to ensure that they arealigned with the Paris Agreement and GBF goals. We will work –including withpartner countries- to ensure MDBs fully align their activities with the ParisAgreement in accordance with their timebound commitments, and by 2025 at thelatest. We will also support them to align with the GBF by implementing the MDBCOP26 Joint Statement on Nature, including tracking and scaling up ﬁnance fornature.
124. Last year, the UK also co-launched a Joint Donor Statement onInternational Finance for Biodiversity and Nature. This statement by 14countries included a commitment to collectively increase international biodiversityﬁnance and align relevant international development ﬂows commensurate with theambition of the GBF. This means mitigating nature-related risks and impacts;assessing risks across ﬁnancial systems from biodiversity loss; supporting recipientcountries’ transitions to net zero, nature positive economies; and increasing ﬁnancealigned with the international mission to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030.
125. The UK has worked to drive broader international action by public ﬁnance,including building a coalition of 39 signatories to the COP 26 Clean EnergyTransition Partnership (CETP),[footnote 76] committing to shift international publicsupport out of the fossil fuel energy sector and into clean energy; as well as acommitment in the G7 to end new support for fossil fuels by the end of 2022. Whenfully implemented, the CETP and G7 commitments have the potential to shift $39billion per year into the clean energy transition.[footnote 77] A number of countrieshave implemented their commitments in line with the UK policy, and we are nowprioritising the full implementation of all other commitments.
126. We also make sure UK supported lending is done in a sustainable manner.The UK adheres to the G20 Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Finance, aswell as being the ﬁrst G7 country to publish its sovereign debt portfolio, and weencourage all ofﬁcial creditors to do likewise. Similar guidance exists for privatecreditors.
2.6.3 Building partnerships with emerging markets and developingeconomies127. EMDEs have the largest investment needs for achieving climate andenvironment goals, but generally have less developed capital markets. In order toaccelerate the growth in green ﬁnance in these economies, the UK supports these

countries by sharing expertise from implementation of our own policies, ensuringthey have the ﬁnancial capabilities necessary to fulﬁl their climate and nature goals.
128. As this strategy shows, there is signiﬁcant interdependency between differentaspects of green ﬁnance policy frameworks, such as between disclosurerequirements, taxonomies, and transition plans. The global economy is learninghow to green ﬁnancial systems at a rapid rate by implementing climate-alignedpolicies. That is why we must take a strategic approach to interventions to enablecountries to put in place the building blocks of functioning green ﬁnance eco-systems, which can be developed over time and tailored to local contexts.
129. We will therefore accelerate the dissemination of learning from implementationin the UK through our international networks and partnerships. This includesthrough delivering on the International Development Strategy commitment oflaunching our Financial Services Centre of Expertise. The Centre will leveragethe UK’s strengths to provide tailored support on ﬁnancial market development inEMDEs with a heavy emphasis on green ﬁnance, we expect the Centre to be fullyoperational by 2025. Our aim is to facilitate EMDEs to develop net zero alignedﬁnancial systems. This will enable them to address data gaps, access internationalgreen ﬁnance ﬂows, avoid a proliferation of standards and practices, and betterenable the UK ﬁnancial sector to support the development of, and provide capitalto, net zero transitions globally.
130. To make future interventions as targeted and effective as possible we will workwith industry and country partners to develop an information toolkit foroptimising support for the greening of ﬁnancial systems in EMDEs. This willenable efforts to build capability to be made more strategic as we advance towardsan interoperable green ﬁnancial system, and to remain responsive to local contextswhilst being informed by growing expertise and policy advancement in the UK. Itwill be accompanied by efforts to bolster the sharing of UK green ﬁnance skills andexpertise via UK International Climate Finance (ICF) programming. These actionswill increase the ability of EMDEs to develop policies, capabilities, and markets toservice their ﬁnancing needs, whilst building closer relationships with the UK andour world leading ﬁnancial sector.
Box 14: UK leadership and assistance to build capacity in emergingmarkets and developing economies
In line with our international commitments and the approach set out through theInternational Development Strategy, the UK directly assists emerging marketsand developing economies by building capability and capacity to implementmeasures to green their ﬁnancial systems. As well as supporting knowledgesharing and collaboration through a range of international fora andpartnerships, part of our £11.6 billion I C F commitment is delivered throughprogramming which helps build capability, such as:
UK Partnering for Accelerated Climate Transitions (UK PACT) usescountry programmes, skill-shares, secondments and technical assistance togreen ﬁnancial systems.

Financial Sector Deepening Africa works with policymakers, investors andissuers to green ﬁnancial systems by advising on regulatory reform,mobilising green capital, supporting issuance of green bonds and catalysinggreen technologies.The Bank of England shares its expertise to enable central banks toimplement effective public ﬁnancial management, such as through runningclimate scenario analysis workshops in 2022 with central banks fromcountries across Africa and Asia.The Nature Positive Economy Programme will be delivered in partnershipwith the UN Development Programme’s Biodiversity Finance Initiative(BioFin) and Financial Sector Deepening Africa. This supports governments,central banks, businesses, and ﬁnancial institutions to integrate nature-related risks and opportunities into decision-making.The NDC Partnership is supported by a £23 million UK contribution. Underits ﬁnance strategy, the Partnership is building green capabilities in centralbanks, integrating nationally determined contributions (NDCs) into publicﬁnancial management and engaging with the private sector to tailor effectiveenabling environments for investment.
Chapter 3: Invest – Mobilising and creatingopportunities for green investment
1. Investment is key to delivering a thriving green economy at home and abroad,and the UK business and investment landscape is one of the most competitive,attractive and innovative in the world. The UK ranks second in Europe for mostattractive renewable investment opportunities[footnote 78]; ﬁrst in Europe in terms ofmost active, deepest capital markets[footnote 79]; and fourth in the global innovationindex[footnote 80].
2. Our 2019 ‘Green Finance Strategy’ established that the strategic use of publicfunds, long-term policy frameworks and market signalling can mobilise privateinvestment. The UK government has since taken major steps towards delivering onthis (see Chapter 1: Foundations, section 1.3). We committed £30 billion ofdomestic investment for the green industrial revolution at Spending Review 2021,as well as £6 billion for energy efﬁciency at the Autumn Statement 2022 and upto £20 billion for CCUS announced at Spring Budget 2023.
3. This chapter sets out how government and public ﬁnance institutions will act tomobilise the private capital needed to drive forward an economy-widetransformation at the scale and pace required to deliver our net zero, environmentaland climate adaptation commitments. This includes mobilising investment towardsemerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) in support of the globaltransition.
4. This chapter sits alongside ‘Powering Up Britain’ published today.[^81 ] Thepolicies and ambitions we have committed to will help leverage around £100 billionof private investment as we develop new industries and innovative low carbon

technologies. It also sits alongside our ‘Environmental Improvement Plan’ (January2023), setting out how we will improve the natural environment and our new ‘NatureMarkets Framework’, also published today.[footnote 82] Together these communicateto businesses, investors and the ﬁnance sector, here and abroad, the UK’s plan togrow green investment across all parts of the UK – setting a clear direction,creating investment opportunities and providing a comprehensive framework ofgovernment support.
5. Our approach builds on the feedback we heard from the investment and ﬁnancecommunity through our call for evidence (summer 2022).
Box 15: Call for Evidence feedback – stakeholder views on UK next steps
Ask 1: Improve the long-term clarity investors and businesses have in thepathways for key sectors and technologies that will underpin a net zero,resilient and nature positive economy. We address this is in section 3.1.Ask 2: Work closely with public ﬁnance institutions such as the UKInfrastructure Bank, British Business Bank, UK Research & Innovation andUK’s export credit agency, UK Export Finance, to deploy public levers thatwill crowd in and de-risk investment in key sectors and technologies. Weaddress this in section 3.2.Ask 3: Ensure all parts of the project development and investment chain,including local government and businesses, have the capacity to developinvestor ready projects and raise capital. We address this in sections 3.2.,3.2.4, 3.3 and 3.4.Ask 4: Improve the technical capacity of emerging markets and developingeconomies to attract green investment and use public ﬁnance levers to de-risk investment, building new export markets for UK businesses andsupporting a global transition. We address this in section 3.5.
3.1 Green investment across the UK economy: progress,priorities and the path ahead
3.1.1 Progress to date in driving green investment6. The economic, business and ﬁnancial transformation ahead creates investmentopportunities across every sector of the UK economy. The UK has already madesigniﬁcant progress in attracting investment into green sectors. Annual investmentin low carbon sectors has more than doubled in real terms over the past 5 years.Across 2021 and 2022 alone, £50 billion of new investments were delivered in lowcarbon sectors in the UK.[footnote 83]
7. These investments are being made across all regions of the UK, and support ourmission to level up the UK.[footnote 84] Figure 5 below highlights some of the projectsthat have secured investment in recent years to support our net zero objective.

8. That said, the transition required to meet our net zero, climate resilience andenvironmental objectives will require signiﬁcant further private investment across allareas of the economy (see section 3.1.2). We are in an increasingly competitiveinternational race to secure this investment and so the UK government iscommitted to act now. We will answer investor and industry calls to provide thelong-term certainty, strategic de-risking, and conﬁdence to invest in thetechnologies and infrastructure necessary to deliver our green investmentobjectives.

3.1.2 Investment priorities across our green objectives
Net zero and energy security9. We estimate that to deliver on the UK’s net zero ambitions, through the late2020s and 2030s, an additional £50-60 billion of capital investment will be requiredeach year. Most of this investment will need to come from the private sector.[footnote85] Investment in supply chains in the UK are an important part of this, ensuringenergy security and enabling us to capture global growth opportunities in newgreen industries.

Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
10. Accompanying strategies, including Powering Up Britain, set out deploymentgoals and policies for the decarbonisation and growth of sectors across the UKeconomy. These world leading ambitions – such as delivering up to 50G W offshorewind capacity by 2030[footnote 86]; up to 70G W of solar by 2035[footnote 87]; up to10G W of low carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030[footnote 88], at least 5Mtof CO2 removal through greenhouse gas removals (GGRs)[footnote 89] and toincrease plans for civil nuclear deployment to up to 24 G W by 2050[footnote 90] – arealready driving investment in innovation, scaling of sectors and deployment oftechnologies.
Nature11. The UK government has set a legally binding target to halt the decline indomestic species abundance in England by 2030, and then increase abundance byat least 10% to exceed 2022 levels by 2042.[footnote 91] This target, together withother goals set out in our Environmental Improvement Plan published in January2023, sets a clear direction that can help to make the UK a leader in privateinvestment in natural capital.
12. To support this, we have set a goal to mobilise at least £500 million of privateﬁnance per year into nature’s recovery in England by 2027, rising to more than £1billion per year by 2030.[footnote 92] We expect to see this ﬁnance made upprincipally of investment in nature-based solutions for carbon sequestration, ﬂoodrisk management and water quality, as well as compensating for biodiversity andnutrient impacts (for example, through Biodiversity Net Gain and Marine Net Gain).
Climate adaptation and resilience13. To prepare the UK for the physical effects of climate change - across ﬂoodprotection, the public water system, housing retroﬁt for overheating, naturerestoration and broader infrastructure - indicative estimates from the ClimateChange Committee (CCC) suggest that additional investment of around £5 billionper year this decade will be needed. If considering all 61 risks and opportunitiesidentiﬁed in the UK’s third Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA3), this couldplausibly rise to £10 billion per year.[footnote 93]
14. Investment in making the UK resilient to the impacts of climate change willrealise substantial beneﬁts in reducing short and long-term costs to the UKeconomy.[footnote 94] However, there is currently uncertainty around: the optimalscale and beneﬁts of investing in resilience, nationally or by economic sectors; howthat investment should change over time; and the optimal source of thatinvestment, whether public or private.
15. The UK government, working with the CCC, is scoping research requirementsin adaptation investment needs. The analysis will expand on the CCC’s 2023 reporton adaptation ﬁnance to improve the evidence base, and ﬁndings will be publishedin the fourth Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA4), due for publication in2027.

Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
16. To implement long term investment strategies that support our objectives,investors need greater clarity on the pathways for the sectors and technologiesneeded to support this economic transition. In 2022 we published several net zeroinvestment roadmaps, which summarised government policies and opportunitiesavailable for speciﬁc sectors (automotive[footnote 95], hydrogen[footnote 96],CCUS[footnote 97], Jet Zero[footnote 98]). We will continue to develop these further toreﬂect sectoral investment needs, and commit to working with investors to ensurethey contain the information and clarity that will support investment decisions.Alongside this Strategy, we have published a roadmap on offshore wind, and willshortly publish a roadmap on heat pumps, as well as updated roadmaps on CCUS,and hydrogen. We plan to publish roadmaps for further sectors later this year tosupport the net zero transition and will refresh them as necessary when there aresigniﬁcant developments.
17. A number of sectors (such as agriculture, forestry, water, resources and waste)also have a critical role to play in delivering the goals set out in our EnvironmentalImprovement Plan, in addition to the key contribution they will make to meeting ournet zero target. We will aim to publish an investment roadmap by 2024 to supportthe nature-positive transition pathway for these sectors and will update them aspolicy develops.
Monitoring green investment ﬂows18. Tracking investment ﬂows will help industry and the UK government to monitorprogress against our targets and provide timely assessment on the impact of UKgovernment interventions and industry response. In the Net Zero Strategy, inresponse to calls from the CCC and National Audit Ofﬁce, the UK governmentcommitted to ‘work with external partners and data providers to better track privateinvestment into the net zero economy going forward’.[footnote 99] We are alsocommitted to monitoring annual private ﬁnance ﬂows into nature’s recovery inEngland against our target.
19. Meeting these commitments, the UK government has commissioned 2 piecesof external research to scope existing investment tracking methodologies andevaluate available data sources. The ﬁrst of these is the UK Landscape of ClimateFinance research to track investment into net zero sectors (see Box 16 below). Thesecond is focused on exploring options to track private investment into naturewhich we plan to publish shortly. We are looking at the feasibility of adopting someof the methods recommended.
Box 16: UK Landscape of Climate Finance (LCF) research
The methodology and data scoping phase will inform development of a pilot UKLandscape of Climate Finance (LCF) model, and is due to conclude in Summer2023. This research will aim to track investment ﬂows from public and privatesources of ﬁnance into net zero sectors. This is a critical ﬁrst step taken by theUK government to build the evidence base on green investment ﬂows in theUK. Stakeholder engagement with data holders, ﬁnancial sector participantsand existing LCF developers has informed this scoping phase.

Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
This research will identify key data gaps. We can then explore how to addressthese as part of our commitment to investigate how we apply a systematic androbust approach to tracking annual investment ﬂows.
3.2 Government and public sector levers to mobilise privateinvestment
3.2.1 Our strategic approach to mobilise investment20. The right policy frameworks and signals can shape and accelerate the growthof the sectors and technologies, supporting the market to drive solutions. Centralgovernment, public ﬁnance institutions and local authorities all have a critical role.This includes providing the funding and incentives that both de-risk projects andimprove the clarity of policy direction to instil investor conﬁdence.
21. Published alongside this Strategy, the ‘Powering Up Britain’ provides moredetail on how the UK government will use policy, regulatory and funding levers, ona sectoral and whole-economy basis, to provide businesses and investors withconﬁdence in critical net zero sectors and technologies. These build on the UKgovernment’s long-term plan and strong policy framework set out in the ‘Net ZeroStrategy’ and ‘British Energy Security Strategy’.
22. Similarly, our Environmental Improvement Plan (2023) also sets out how the UKgovernment plans to achieve a range of targets and goals for the naturalenvironment in England, providing clear long-term signals to investors.
23. On climate adaptation, we will build a launchpad for private and publiccollaboration over the next 5 years to overcome barriers to investment and assist inthe creation and functioning of new markets. We will announce our approachalongside our adaptation ﬁnance deliverables and action plan by the end of 2024.
Box 17: Case study of offshore wind - effectiveness of UK policyframework
The growth of the offshore wind sector is a great example of the effectivenessof the UK policy framework in attracting private investment. The government’searlier support scheme (Renewables Obligation and Final Investment DecisionEnabling for Renewables) brought forward a signiﬁcant amount of deploymentwhich accelerated investment, technological development and learning. TheContracts for Difference (CfD) support scheme (see section 3.2.2), launched in2014, drove competition and cost reduction. Between the ﬁrst CfD allocationround in 2015 and the fourth in 2022 the per unit (MWh) price of offshore windfell by almost 70%.
The UK now has the highest deployment of offshore wind capacity in Europe,the ﬁrst, second, third and fourth largest operational offshore wind farm projects

in the world, and by 2030 we could have more than enough wind capacity topower every home in Britain[footnote 100].
Commercial maturity of key sectors and technologies24. Many of the key sectors and technologies needed to support the transition to anet zero, resilient and nature positive economy have ﬁnancial returns that arecurrently too low or risky to attract investment in the market.
25. Recognising differences in commercial maturity is therefore an important part ofdetermining how we address barriers to attracting investment. Figure 6 belowshows an indicative snapshot of the commercial maturity in the UK of certain keysectors and technologies needed to meet our net zero, nature and climateadaptation commitments. This inﬂuences the type of support needed, from early-stage grant funding, to loans and guarantees, tax credits and allowances, revenuesupport models, or co-investment on major infrastructure projects.

The role of public ﬁnance institutions and UK Export Finance26. The UK’s public ﬁnance institutions and UK’s export credit agency, UK ExportFinance (UKEF) play a key role in supporting sectors and technologies tocommercial maturity and scale (see Table 2). As illustrated by Figure 7, UKRI tendto focus on earlier stage support for innovation, the BBB support smallerbusinesses vital to commercialisation of green technologies, while UKIB and UKEFsupport ﬁrst-of-a-kind commercial deployment, and later stage scaling-up andgrowth stages for businesses and technologies. Since the ﬁrst Green FinanceStrategy, they have each made formal commitments, or established with a mandate(in the case of UKIB), to prioritise net zero as part of their portfolios.

3.2.2 Government and public levers to support a whole economy transition28. The actions set out in Powering Up Britain and the Environmental ImprovementPlan show how government and public levers are being, and will be, used toprovide businesses and investors with conﬁdence across:
new and emerging technologies: providing research and innovation supportcommercialisation: support for technologies and businesses ﬁnding a route tomarketgrowing green sectors: government and public levers helping sectors scale upestablished sectors: supporting the transition to greener practicesclimate resilience and adaptation across the economy: enabling andstimulating investment into climate resilience
29. We have set out below how these actions will mobilise investment. Moreinformation on speciﬁc policies can be found in the ‘Powering Up Britain - EnergySecurity’ and ‘Net Zero Growth Plan’ and ‘Environmental Improvement Plan’.
New and emerging technologies: providing research and innovation support30. Strategic, sustained, long-term investment in research, innovation, skills andinfrastructure across the UK will be vital for meeting our climate, nature andadaptation commitments. Publicly funded research and innovation (R&I) isimportant where market failures or barriers are holding back private sectorinvestment, and to create and shape markets which may not otherwise form fastenough to meet our targets.
31. In the Spring Budget 2023 we signalled our intent to increase support for theUK’s most innovative companies by extending the British Patient Capitalprogramme a further 10 years until 2033-34 and increasing its focus on research &development intensive industries, providing at least £3 billion in investment. Wehave also committed to increase domestic public investment in R&D outside theGreater South East by at least 40% by 2030.[footnote 112]
32. The Net Zero R&I Delivery Plan published alongside this Strategy outlines theUK government’s current portfolio of net zero R&I programmes for 2022 to 2025,based on the challenges outlined in the Net Zero Research and InnovationFramework.[footnote 113] In total, we expect to invest £4.2 billion in net zero R&I over2022 to 2025, delivered through government and UKRI programmes. Furtherfunding from Ofgem’s £450 million Strategic Innovation Fund (£263 million during

2022 to 2025) is being invested on innovation related to energy networks. Our netzero-related R&I funding includes:
a. The £1 billion Net Zero Innovation Portfolio (NZIP)[footnote 114] and the£385 million Advanced Nuclear Fund which aim to accelerate thecommercialisation of low carbon technologies, systems and business models inpower, buildings, greenhouse gas removals and industry;b. The £206 million investment in the UK Shipping Ofﬁce for ReducingEmissions (UK SHORE) to develop and demonstrate pre-commercial cleanmaritime technologies and support accelerating the deployment of near-commercial solutions;[footnote 115]c. The £200 million Zero Emission Road Freight Demonstrator, supportingindustry to demonstrate multiple zero emission HGV technologies andassociated infrastructure at scale on UK roads, enabling multi-year datacollection in real world operations;[footnote 116]d. The £685 million for the Aerospace Technology Institute programme from2022 to 2025 to support the development of new low- and zero-carbon aircraft;[footnote 117]
e. At least £75 million for net zero-related research into natural resources,waste and F-gases from 2022 to 2025.[footnote 118]
33. Other examples of R&I support that contribute to our broader nature andclimate adaptation commitments are:
a. The £200 million for the Flood and Coastal Innovation Programme(FCIP), including a wide range of innovative projects such as apps alertingresidents to ﬂooding, actions to improve drainage and schemes to protect vitalsand dune beaches;b. The £270 million committed to agricultural and horticultural R&Dthrough the Farming Innovation Programme (FIP) to 2029, to enhanceproductivity, environmental sustainability and resilience in England’s farmingsectors; andc. Supporting 86 innovative nature projects across England to explore ways ofgenerating revenue from nature markets and operate on repayable privatesector investment, through the £10 million Natural Environment InvestmentReadiness Fund (NEIRF).
Box 18: UKRI & Innovate UK
UK Research & Innovation (UKRI) investment in research, innovation, andskills creates the conditions for the UK to address the complex and interrelatedchallenges of achieving net zero by 2050. Beyond early-stage research,investment in new technologies is essential to bring them closer tocommercialisation. Building on a substantial £800 million per annum portfolio inthis area, UKRI will continue to make strategic investments that fast-trackprogress to achieving this ambition. Examples of UKRI programmes that driveinvestment into emerging green technologies include:

Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
Innovate UK, the UK’s national innovation agency, supporting business-ledinnovation in all sectors, technologies and UK regions. Between 2015 and2020 Innovate UK supported 5,940 companies with £1.9 billion of net zerorelated grants. As a result, these businesses created 67,000 new jobs, andwent on to raise £4.8 billion of private investment[footnote 119].Innovate UK’s ‘Financing Net Zero’ programme, which focuses onunlocking investment to scale net zero innovation by: i) educating investorson climate tech solutions, ii) upskilling businesses and local authorities tobecome investment ready; iii) building interactions between climate techinvestors and businesses to increase deal ﬂow and iv) unlocking marketsthrough demand led innovation.Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)‘Prosperity Partnerships’ are business-led research that arises from anindustrial need, with the work being co-delivered between the business andacademic partners. This supports excellent, world leading fundamentalresearch which has clear beneﬁt to the businesses involved, resulting inaccelerated impact arising from the new knowledge, innovations, ortechnologies. For every £1 the UK government invests in net zero researchthrough EPSRC’s Prosperity Partnerships, an additional £1.34 is invested byindustry partners.UKRI has invested £5 million in a research network to help UK agri-foodindustry reach net zero. Supported by BBSRC, ESRC, EPSRC and NERC,the network will bring UK researchers together to explore effective ways tosupport the industry to reduce its GHG emissions and improve itsenvironmental sustainability.
Commercialisation: support for technologies and businesses ﬁnding a routeto market
Bridging the innovation to commercialisation gap
34. Accessing venture capital is an important next step for businesses looking totransition from the R&D stage to rapidly scale up and move up the commercialmaturity curve. The UK is Europe’s most developed venture capital market[footnote120], ranks top in Europe for total climate tech venture capital funding between 2013and the ﬁrst half of 2021[footnote 121], and we recently supported the launch ofCleantech for UK, a coalition of leading entrepreneurs and investors committed toscaling clean tech businesses[footnote 122]. We recognise that the UK governmenthas a role working alongside the private sector to improve access to venture capitalfor green technologies, and the approach taken to the Clean Growth Fund (CGF) isa prime example.
Box 19: Clean Growth Fund
In the 2019 ‘Green Finance Strategy’ the UK government committed £20 millionto a new clean growth venture capital fund, with a view to catalysing the Clean

Growth equity ﬁnancing market. Launched in May 2020, the Clean GrowthFund (CGF) is a venture capital fund backed by both public and privateinvestors. It was initially launched with a £40 million cornerstone investment,half funded by the UK government and half funded by CCLA, a specialistinvestment management ﬁrm. The target fund size was £100 million, and thefund achieved ﬁnal close at £101 million, with £20 million from governmentinvested alongside £81 million by the private sector.
The CGF is an independent venture capital fund managed by Clean GrowthInvestment Management LLP. The fund’s focus is on speeding up thecommercialisation of innovative, UK-based, clean technologies that quantiﬁablyreduce GHG emissions. This accelerates deployment, catalyses the UK cleangrowth venture capital market, and leverages further investment into clean techstart-ups. CGF makes direct investments in companies seeking tocommercialise promising technologies. Investments are made across thetechnology spectrum, including hardware, software, process systems,materials, deep tech and business model innovations.
To date, CGF has invested £26.5 million into 10 companies who are deployingthe following solutions to market: enabling ﬂexibility on the power grid, thermalbattery solutions to heat domestic buildings, industrial biotechnology tosynthesise clean chemicals, software to optimise solar farms, renewableenergy integration into logistics transport and technology designed to captureCO2 from energy intensive industries.
Support for small businesses
35. Smaller businesses across the UK have a critical role to play in the transition,by innovating they can pioneer technologies, diffusing these throughout the supplychains. They also need support to address their own carbon footprints (theyaccount for almost a third of UK GHG emissions and around 50% of total GHGemissions from UK businesses[footnote 123]) and respond to supply chain challengesas corporate clients adopt net zero and other environmental targets.
36. The shape, scale and timing of these opportunities and challenges differ frombusiness to business, but also from region to region within the UK. Depending ontheir business stage and the maturity of their product or service, smaller businesseswill need many diverse types of ﬁnance to succeed, and costs are a frequently citedbarrier impeding action.[footnote 124] Support for smaller businesses is thereforeimportant for unlocking green investment opportunities.
37. The UK government supports businesses by providing information andencouraging greater action to meet their net zero commitments via the UKBusiness Climate Hub (BCH), part of the international SME Climate Hub. Throughthe BCH, smaller businesses in the UK are encouraged to join the UN’s ‘Race toZero’ initiative – a global effort to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases we allgenerate to zero by 2050. More than 3,700 UK small businesses have joined thisinitiative and set robust, measurable net zero targets.

38. Public ﬁnancing is also available for small businesses: the BBB offers a rangeof equity and debt programmes – delivered via intermediary private ﬁnanceinstitutions – to suit business needs, and between 2014 and August 2022 hassupported £505 million of clean technology equity investments.
Box 20: British Business Bank
The British Business Bank’s (BBB) remit is to help smaller businessesovercome the numerous ﬁnance barriers they face as they start up, grow andsucceed. In 2023, BBB will launch a strategy that describes its role in the netzero transition and provides a long-term view as all BBB programmes become“sustainable by default” over time. BBB is exploring the potential use of itsexisting products including guarantees to catalyse lending and investment intocritical transition themes such as retroﬁt and energy efﬁciency, and electricvehicle adoption. Given the importance of place-based ﬁnance, the BBB willalso explore green investment issues including in the new Nations and RegionsInvestment Funds, which will support economic growth by leveraging privatesector investment across a broad range of sectors and incorporating net zeroconsiderations.
BBB also works with the small business and ﬁnance market ecosystems totackle information capacity gaps and raise awareness of potential solutions. Forinstance, through the 2022 Green to Grow campaign[footnote 125], the BBBprovided information to small businesses from a wide range of sources on thebeneﬁts of sustainability, explaining how ﬁnance can help and providing casestudies that highlight good practices and champions.[footnote 126] The BBB isalso working with Bankers for Net Zero on solutions to make GHG emissionsreporting frictionless for small companies.
Case study: Teesside-based Nova Pangaea’s patented process convertswoody and agricultural residues into high-value sustainable products that willbe used to produce sustainable aviation fuel for British Airways. Successivefunding rounds from the British Business Bank’s Northern PowerhouseInvestment Fund and grant funding support from the Department for Transporthave enabled Nova Pangaea to build a demonstration plant and prove thecapability of its process.[footnote 127]
Growing green sectors: government and public levers to help sectors scaleup
39. Sectors and technologies moving towards commercial maturity must attractfurther investment to scale up capacity, remain cost and price competitive, andmaintain resilient supply chains in the face of increasing global demand for inputs.The right policy frameworks, market arrangements and signals can act as a catalystfor more investment. Giving clarity around public funding and incentives in theshort-term, with appropriate market frameworks and policy direction in the long-term, helps increase private sector conﬁdence and reduce ﬁnancing costs for greeninvestment projects.

Types of levers
40. The UK government deploys grant funding to reduce upfront costs for largeinvestments in infrastructure or manufacturing in the short-term. Key examples ofthis are:
a. The £1 billion CCUS Infrastructure Fund (CIF) to help reduce the capitalcosts borne by private investors in strategic CCUS infrastructure, transport andstorage networks, and industrial carbon capture (ICC) projects (see Fuel Supplyand Hydrogen chapter of the Net Zero Growth Plan);[footnote 128]b. The £240 million Net Zero Hydrogen Fund (NZHF) to support thedevelopment and construction of new low carbon hydrogen production plantsthat can deploy in the 2020s, including both CCUS-enabled and electrolytichydrogen. The ﬁrst competition window for Strands 1 and 2 of the NZHF ranfrom April to July 2022, aimed at projects which require development or capitalcosts without revenue support, and successful applicants have beenannounced alongside this Strategy (see Fuel Supply and Hydrogen chapter ofthe ‘Net Zero Growth Plan’);[footnote 129]c. The £30 million Heat Pump Investment Accelerator Competition to driveinvestment in domestic manufacturing of heat pumps (see Heat and Buildingschapter of the Net Zero Growth Plan);[footnote 130]d. The up to £160 million Floating Offshore Wind ManufacturingInvestment Scheme[footnote 131] to kick start investment in port infrastructureprojects needed to deliver our ﬂoating offshore wind ambitions, and theOffshore Wind Manufacturing Investment Scheme[footnote 132] whichsupported major port infrastructure and manufacturing investment (see Powerchapter of the ‘Net Zero Growth Plan’);e. The Automotive Transformation Fund has been developed to support thecreation of an internationally competitive, electric vehicle supply chain in theUK; andf. The £165 million Advanced Fuels Fund to support the development ofcommercial scale sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plants in the UK (seeTransport chapter of ‘Powering Up Britain - Energy Security’ and ‘Net ZeroGrowth Plans’).[footnote 133]
41. We also enable consumers to access smaller increments of funding toreduce burden on them and help them purchase low carbon goods, which createsa positive demand signal and encourages investment. A key example of this is thenew Energy Company Obligation scheme – the Great British Insulation Scheme– which will deliver £1 billion additional investment by March 2026 in energyefﬁciency upgrades, such as loft and cavity wall insulation.
Box 21: Using different levers to drive investment in energy efﬁciency andlow carbon heating across homes, businesses and the public sector

energy prices. We are investing over £6.6 billion this parliament towardsimproving energy efﬁciency and low carbon heating, and will be investing afurther £6 billion over 2025 to 2028.
Whether the challenge is retroﬁtting the UK’s housing stock, decarbonising itsbusinesses, or developing retroﬁt programmes for public sector buildings, suchas schools, colleges and hospitals, the provision of ﬁnance and supportingdevelopment of the right supply chains are essential. As set out in Heat &Buildings chapter of the Net Zero Growth Plan, some of the recent steps havetaken include:
Establishing the Energy Efﬁciency Taskforce to support the reduction ofthe UK’s ﬁnal energy consumption from buildings and industry by 15% by2030 against 2021 levels.[footnote 134]The Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) is providing £450 million between2022 to 2025, and we have announced this will now be extended to at least2028. The scheme has led to a number of offers, from both energy suppliersand ﬁnancial lenders, that utilise B U S funding to reduce and spread theupfront cost, supporting the expansion of the low carbon heat market, scalingup manufacturing and upskilling installers.[footnote 135]The £1.425 billion Phase 3 of the Public Sector DecarbonisationScheme will provide grant funding over the ﬁnancial years 2022/23 -2024/25. Phases 1 and 2 provided more than £1 billion in grants over theﬁnancial years 2020/21 and 2021/22.[footnote 136]The up to £20 million Green Home Finance Accelerator to support thedevelopment of innovative green ﬁnance products that help homeownerswith upfront costs of energy improvements. We expect to fund up to 27successful projects, supported by around £4 million of initial grant funding fora 6-month Discovery Phase.[footnote 137]
42. Our medium-term approach is to design sectoral market support ‘businessmodels’. Business models are tailored to the needs and circumstances of sectors,and support mechanisms are designed in consultation with industry so that we canreduce risk and provide long-term clarity. This is particularly helpful for sectors thatface signiﬁcant uncertainty around future prices and costs. Key examples are:
a. The Contracts for Difference (CfD) renewable support scheme, whichhas been highly effective in mobilising investment in renewables in the UK anddriving down cost since it was launched in 2014.[footnote 138] CfDs incentiviseinvestment by providing revenue stability while protecting consumers from risingcosts. The last CfD round, Allocation Round 4 in July 2022, was our largestever, supporting an expanded number of renewable technologies and securingalmost 11GW of low carbon capacity.[footnote 139] (See Power chapter of the ‘NetZero Growth Plan’ and chapter 4 of ‘Powering Up Britain - Energy SecurityPlan’.)b. The Regulated Asset Base (RAB) funding model for future nuclearprojects[footnote 140] introduced in 2022. RAB models have been successfullyused for many years to ﬁnance large, long-term single-asset infrastructure

projects in the UK. In November 2022, the UK government conﬁrmed aninvestment of £700 million in the Sizewell C project.[footnote 141] This representsone of our biggest steps yet in our journey to energy independence. (SeePower chapter of the ‘Net Zero Growth Plan’ and chapter 4 of ‘Powering UpBritain - Energy Security Plan’.)c. The Hydrogen Production Business Model (HPBM) will provide revenuesupport to hydrogen producers to overcome the operating cost gap betweenlow carbon hydrogen and high carbon fuels. In December 2022 we set out themodel design in the HPBM Heads of Terms which will form the basis of the LowCarbon Hydrogen Agreement (LCHA) signed with hydrogen producers.[footnote142] Alongside this Strategy, we have published the shortlist of projects for theUK’s ﬁrst electrolytic hydrogen allocation round (HAR1)[footnote 143] to takeforward to due diligence, and re-conﬁrmed our aim to award contracts totallingup to 250MW capacity through this round. Successful projects in this round willbe funded by government until the hydrogen levy is in place. In August 2022,we also published a consultation on Hydrogen Transport and StorageBusiness Models, as part of our commitment to design these by 2025.[footnote144] We are aiming to introduce legislative powers, when parliamentary timeallows, which will be crucial to designing these new business models by 2025.(See Fuel Supply and Hydrogen chapter of the ‘Net Zero Growth Plan’ andchapter 4 of ‘Powering Up Britain - Energy Security Plan’.)d. A suite of CCUS business models[footnote 145] are being developed, tailoredto different parts of the CCUS sector. (See Fuel Supply and Hydrogen chapterof the ‘Net Zero Growth Plan’ and chapter 4 of the ‘Energy Security Plan’.)These include:
i. the transport and storage (‘T&S’) business model to establish thecommercial arrangements that will fund transport and storage infrastructureand enable CCUS clusters;ii. the industrial carbon capture (ICC) and waste ICC business modelsto provide ongoing revenue support for industrial and waste managementemitters to decarbonise;iii. the Dispatchable Power Agreement (DPA) contractual framework forpower CCUS, published in November 2022; andiv. the power bioenergy with CCS (power BECCS) business model,consulted on in August 2022 with our response published imminently.
e. We consulted on the design of engineered Greenhouse Gas Removals(GGR) Business Models in July 2022.[footnote 146] The consultation alsoexplored options for building a negative greenhouse gas emissions market inthe UK and key considerations in relation to the monitoring, reporting andveriﬁcation of engineered GGRs. We intend to respond and set out the nextsteps this year. (See Greenhouse Gas Removals chapter of the ‘Net ZeroGrowth Plan’.)
43. As part of the British Energy Security Strategy, we announced the Review ofElectricity Market Arrangements (REMA) programme. It is exploring enduringreforms to our electricity (non-retail) market arrangements to ensure that they

remain ﬁt both for today and future generations. We aim to publish a second REMAconsultation in Autumn 2023 and will take decisions on shorter-term reforms morequickly where it is viable to do so throughout the REMA programme (see chapter 5of the ‘Energy Security Plan’).
44. We also deploy regulation to set standards, create demand and supplysignals, and create new market frameworks. These also act as signals for investorsto identify investible opportunities across sectors. Key examples are:
a. The Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate[footnote 147] planned from 2024will support delivery of the phase out of the sale of new petrol and diesel carsand vans from 2030, and ensure that all new cars and vans are zero emissionsat the tailpipe from 2035. This is driving adoption and deployment of zeroemission vehicles, as well as investment in their manufacturing, supply chainsand enabling infrastructure. (See Transport chapter of the ‘Net Zero GrowthPlan’.)b. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate starting in 2025 with a targetof at least 10% SAF in the UK aviation fuel mix by 2030. This aims to reduceGHG emissions from aviation by generating demand for SAF and providing anincentive to SAF producers in the form of tradeable certiﬁcates. It also sends along-term signal to investors on the vital role the government believes thetechnology will play in the UK. In March 2023, we launched a secondconsultation on the mandate’s design. We commissioned an independentreview to help understand the conditions needed to create a sustainable long-term UK SAF industry in October 2022. We will very shortly respond to itsﬁndings, and will work with industry on options to increase revenue certainty forUK SAF plants and options to stabilise the UK market for feedstocks. (SeeTransport chapter of the ‘Net Zero Growth Plan’.)c. The Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard sets a maximum GHG emissionsthreshold for hydrogen production processes to be considered ‘low carbonhydrogen’, and a methodology for calculating GHG emissions.[footnote 148]Compliance with the standard will help ensure new low carbon hydrogenproduction supported by government makes a direct contribution to our carbonreduction targets. (See Fuel Supply & Hydrogen chapter of the Net Zero GrowthPlan.)d. Mandatory Biodiversity Net Gain, which we legislated to introduce in theEnvironment Act 2021, will establish a market for biodiversity units fromNovember 2023.[footnote 149] Land managers who can create or enhance habitaton their land will be able to sell the resulting biodiversity units to developersneeding to meet their obligations. (See Goal 1 ‘Thriving plants and wildlife’ andGoal 6 ‘Using resources from nature sustainably’ of the ‘EnvironmentalImprovement Plan’.)
45. We have committed to publish a Land Use Framework for England in 2023,which will help to inform how we manage trade-offs between different land uses aswe deliver our ambitious climate and environmental goals, and provide greaterclarity to the market. (See Goal 6 ‘Using resources from nature sustainably’ andGoal 7 ‘Mitigating and adapting to climate change’ of the ‘EnvironmentalImprovement Plan’.)

46. Innovations in public ﬁnancing mechanisms have the potential to improve thecapacity to crowd in private investment more effectively. A key example of this isthe use of blended ﬁnance structures which can support projects to secure theinvestment they need, whilst providing value for money for the taxpayer.
47. ‘Blended ﬁnance’ is a catch-all term that covers ﬁnancial products or structuresthat combine different funding sources aimed at lowering the risk proﬁle of speciﬁccompanies or projects and ultimately attracting private capital.
48. Examples include public sector provision of concessional guarantees, ﬁrst losstranches of debt structures, performance wraps (insurance), and subordinateddebt. All are examples of a creative use of traditional grant funding, that can becustomised to the involved parties’ priorities and risk appetites, and can target aparticular sector, project type or context.
Box 22: Blended ﬁnance case studies focusing on nature markets
The UK government is investing £30 million Big Nature Impact Fund (BNIF),a new blended ﬁnance impact fund managed by Federated Hermes andFinance Earth.[footnote 150] Our catalytic investment will crowd in signiﬁcantlevels of private capital, with the aim of developing a track record for privatesector investment in nature recovery at scale, which others can follow.
BNIF will accelerate the creation across England of high-integrity natureprojects that generate revenue from ecosystem services such as carbonsequestration, biodiversity and water quality, by creating biodiverse woodlandsand other priority habitats, and restoring peatlands. By taking a blended ﬁnanceapproach and aggregating these projects up to an investible level, BNIF willhelp lower transaction costs and reduce risks, bringing the risk proﬁle of theseprojects in line with institutional investors’ appetite.
The £50 million Woodland Carbon Guarantee helps accelerate woodlandplanting rates and develop the domestic market for woodland carbon, byoffering a price guarantee for veriﬁed carbon credits sold to the UKgovernment.[footnote 151]
Our new Environmental Land Management schemes are being designed todovetail with private investment.[footnote 152] In particular, we are supporting thebespoke Landscape Recovery projects to secure private funding alongsidepublic funds in innovative ways. We have carried out numerous tests and trialslooking at different mechanisms to crowd in private ﬁnance to improve nature’srecovery, and we will continue to learn from these and other projects as privatemarkets for nature develop.
49. Over the past decade the UK has developed signiﬁcant international experiencedeveloping blended ﬁnance instruments, including support for the Global InnovationLab for Climate Finance.153 Many public ﬁnance institutions, public funds andinitiatives also already include a mix of blended ﬁnance options (see Table 2). TheUK Infrastructure Bank has a broad range of options including signiﬁcant (£10

billion) capacity to provide guarantees, and the British Business Bank overseesproducts that use grants and guarantees to crowd in private sector lending. UKExport Finance also works closely with a wide range of private credit insurers andlenders to help UK companies access export ﬁnance, complementing the provisionof support from the private market.
50. To build on a strong track record of existing blended ﬁnance structures andinterventions, the UK government is committed to exploring additional areas wheresuch structures could have impact. We will work with the Green Finance Instituteand industry leaders in the ﬁnance sector to develop a forward-looking analysis ofblended ﬁnance models and where they could be better deployed in the UK.
51. In addition, both our call for evidence and the independent ‘Net Zero Review’highlighted concerns that the broad range of government funding schemes that areavailable for businesses and project developers can at times create unduecomplexity and do not always suit the speciﬁc needs of the relevant sector. The UKgovernment recognises the importance of ensuring the design of fundingschemes is as impactful and effective as possible, and delivers value for money.We will explore the design of funding schemes for net zero projects ahead of thenext Spending Review.
Green infrastructure projects across sectors: common barriers and solutions
52. Much of the green investment required at the stage of commercial maturity isinvestment in infrastructure. Based on industry feedback we understand that thereare signiﬁcant pools of private ﬁnance ready to deploy into green infrastructureprojects but there can be a mismatch between market appetite and the risk proﬁleof green projects. The UK Infrastructure Bank has an important role to play incrowding private investment into these.
Box 23: UK Infrastructure Bank
UKIB published a Strategic Plan in Summer 2022, which sets out how it willdeliver on its mission across its 5 priority sectors: clean energy; digital;transport; water; and, waste.[footnote 154] Projects which UKIB invests in mustmeet its triple bottom line: achieving one or both of its strategic objectives(tackling climate change and promoting economic growth across the UK),generating a positive ﬁnancial return and demonstrating additionality. It willfocus where there’s an undersupply of private ﬁnance and reducing barriers toinvestment – thereby crowding-in private capital.
UKIB has an initial £22 billion of ﬁnancial capacity which it aims to deploy overthe next 5 to 8 years, subject to the pipeline of investable projects. It canprovide corporate and project ﬁnance and invest across the capital structure,including senior debt, mezzanine, guarantees and equity. Where possible,UKIB will invest on terms in line with other sources of ﬁnance. However, it cango further, including: taking on risks that other investors are unwilling – or notyet willing – to take; and offering concessional terms, including on price andtenor, where that is necessary.

Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
UKIB will ﬁnance early-stage technologies commercially deploying for the ﬁrsttime; proven technologies to accelerate their deployment toward governmentambitions; and, mature technologies transitioning to subsidy-free models. It willalso invest in the natural capital market, creating pathways for future privateinvestment by demonstrating the soundness and replicability of emergingbusiness models, including approaches that aggregate projects.
UKIB is now operational and, as of 27 March 2023, has announced 12 deals,investing approximately £1.2 billion and unlocking over £5 billion of privatecapital. Projects that contribute towards meeting net zero include:
committing £162.5 million as a cornerstone investor in Next Power UK ESGfund, the UK’s largest subsidy-free solar fundinvesting £150 million, alongside £1 billion from other investors, in the UKportion of ﬁnance for the 1.4GW NeuConnect interconnector project; andproviding £10 million to the West Midlands Combined Authority, supportingthe introduction of green buses in Birmingham
Case study – Electricity storage: UKIB has announced, alongside thisStrategy, that following an expressions of interest process it will appointmanagers for equity funds covering both short and long duration electricitystorage. UKIB will invest on a matched basis, crowding-in wider sources ofﬁnance. Going forward, UKIB expect to make direct investments in theelectricity storage sector, which was identiﬁed as an investment opportunity intheir Strategic Plan.
53. Heat Networks are an example of an infrastructure investment which willrequire signiﬁcant private sector ﬁnance to help deliver decarbonised heating. Heatnetwork regulation will come into force in 2024 and Heat Network Zoning inEngland will come into force by 2025 to support long-term strategic investment intoheat networks. We are continuing to grow and decarbonise the UK heat networkmarket through the Green Heat Network Fund (GHNF) and can conﬁrm thatcapital support will be extended to 2028, including £220 million to facilitate thecontinued growth of low carbon heat networks over 2025/6 and 2026/7. Localauthorities applying to the UK government’s GHNF for funding can now also accessloans from the UK Infrastructure Bank at preferential rates.[footnote 155]
54. Central to delivery of net zero infrastructure at scale is an efﬁcient planningsystem. It can currently take many years to get a major project through theplanning system, and as volumes and complexity increases, the system isincreasingly facing delays and challenges. We published our action plan inFebruary 2023 to improve the Nationally Signiﬁcant Infrastructure Projectplanning process.[footnote 156] This important document contains a raft of reformsacross the entire system to make it stronger, fairer and faster. We are now alsopublishing 5 revised energy National Policy Statements covering Renewables, Oiland Gas Pipelines, Electricity Networks and Gas Generation, and an overarchingEnergy Statement for consultation. This includes a new requirement for offshorewind to be considered as ‘critical national infrastructure’. (See chapter 4 of‘Powering Up Britain - Energy Security’.)

55. We are also taking steps to increase the use of nature-based solutions withininfrastructure and development in England. The UK government has set anexpectation of a signiﬁcant increase in the use of nature and catchment-basedsolutions in the water sector, with companies and regulators working towardsdelivering these solutions as a matter of preference. As well as mandatingBiodiversity Net Gain for developers and Nationally Signiﬁcant InfrastructureProjects, we are aiming to make Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS)mandatory in new housing developments in 2024, subject to ﬁnal decisions onscope, thresholds and process following consultation.
Established sectors: supporting the transition to a net zero, resilient andnature positive economy
56. As green sectors innovate and grow, it is also crucial that established, highcarbon sectors invest to shift towards greener practices. The UK government’slevers and support can help increase the rate of adoption of greener practices,particularly when they are not yet fully cost- or price-competitive with establishedpractices.
57. A major lever to incentivise uptake of low carbon practices is carbon pricing.The UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) incentivises the reduction ofemissions in a cost-effective way.[footnote 157] A cap is set on the total amount ofcertain greenhouse gases that can be emitted by the sectors covered by thescheme over a given period. This incentivises industries to lower their emissionsimpact and increases the uptake of green technologies, creating positive demandsignals that mobilise investment. The UK government will work with the rest of UKETS Authority[footnote 158] to legislate to continue the ETS beyond 2030, until atleast 2050. The ETS will remain aligned with our net zero goals, so giving theprivate sector the certainty they need to invest in decarbonisation. We will exploreexpanding the scheme to more sectors of the economy, including high emittingsectors. The UK ETS Authority will shortly publish a government response to ourconsultation on initial expansion of the UK ETS’s scope to cover energy fromwaste/waste incineration and domestic maritime emissions.
58. We are providing speciﬁc incentives for industrial sectors to switch fuel andenergy sources, from fossil fuels to electricity and hydrogen, as well as bioenergy,and to support industrial resource efﬁciency and energy efﬁciency. (SeeIndustry chapter of the ‘Net Zero Growth Plan’.) We do this through several levers,such as:
a. The Industrial Energy Transformation Fund (IETF), which provides grantfunding to supporting industry to cut their energy bills and carbon emissionsthrough investing in energy efﬁciency and low carbon technologies. We areannouncing an extension to the I E T F, increasing total grant funding availableby £185 million. Subject to business case approval, we intend to open Phase 3of the I E T F for new applications in early 2024;b. The hydrogen production and CCUS business models (see fullerdescription in ‘Growing green sectors’ section above), which will support CCUSand help make hydrogen a cost competitive option compared to alternativefossil fuels, incentivising their uptake; and

c. The Climate Change Agreements scheme, which we are extending by 2years, and provides reduced Climate Change Levy rates for eligible businessesin over 50 industrial sectors worth an estimated £300 million a year. We arealso publishing a consultation on the detail of the extension and views on apotential future Climate Change Agreements scheme.
59. We recognise that UK industrial electricity prices are higher than those ofother countries, which may be a barrier to investment. We have committed toaddress this to ensure UK industry remains competitive. We have taken severalsteps to reduce the cost of electricity for the UK industrial sector, and energyintensive industries in particular, including:
a. The British Industry Supercharger, with targeted measures to bring theenergy costs for key UK industries in line with other major economies,beneﬁtting 300 businesses across the UK;b. The Energy Intensive Industries (EII) Compensation Scheme, extendeduntil March 2025, helps high energy usage businesses such as steel and papermanufacturers with their electricity costs;c. A commitment to outline a clear approach to gas vs electricity‘rebalancing’ by the end of 2023/4, aiming to make signiﬁcant progressaffecting relative prices by the end of 2024. Rebalancing will generate the clearshort-term price signal necessary to shift businesses to lower carbon, moreenergy efﬁcient technologies like heat pumps. This is vital to meet government’sexisting decarbonisation commitments, including our goal of 600,000 heatpumps installed per year by 2028.
60. Investment in the circular economy and resource efﬁciency can alsocontribute to energy demand reduction targets, whilst increasing the resilience ofUK industrial supply chains. This requires the adoption of new, sustainablebusiness models and growth in the UK’s capacity to reuse, remanufacture andrecycle products and materials. In the Resources and Waste Strategy (2018) andNet Zero Strategy (2021), the UK government has set out plans to support thedevelopment of the circular economy. The UK is well placed to capture theopportunity from this transformation. To support the transition and to help driveinvestment, UKRI has initiated programmes including the National InterdisciplinaryCircular Economy Research (NICER), which is bringing together researchers,businesses, policymakers, and wider society to identify, develop and embedcircular economy approaches and technologies across key industrial sectors.
61. We are working with the oil and gas industry and regulators to decarbonise oiland gas production in the North Sea, primarily through electriﬁcation ofinfrastructure and cessation of routine ﬂaring (see Fuel Supply and Hydrogenchapter in the ‘Net Zero Growth Plan’). Through the North Sea Transition Deal, theindustry is committed to reducing its emissions by 10% by 2025, 25% by 2027 and50% by 2030 (against a 2018 baseline).[footnote 159] The North Sea Transition Dealwill support workers, businesses, and the supply chain through this transition byharnessing the industry’s existing capabilities, infrastructure and private investmentpotential to exploit new and emerging technologies such as hydrogen production,CCUS and ﬂoating offshore wind.

62. Government wants to encourage oil and gas companies to reinvest theirproﬁts in oil and gas extraction from the UK to support the economy, jobs and theUK’s energy security. The Energy Proﬁts Levy on extraordinary oil and gas proﬁtswas increased to 35% in the Autumn Statement, but in recognition of the need tocontinue investing in UK energy security and decarbonisation, it comes with aninvestment allowance for the reinvestment of proﬁts in ring-fenced activities and aseparate investment allowance for investment in carbon emissions reducingtechnology, such as installing bespoke wind turbines to power upstream productionassets.
63. The Energy Proﬁts Levy is accompanied by the temporary Electricity GeneratorLevy, introduced by government on extraordinary returns in the market due toelectricity prices far exceeding historical levels, as a result of Putin’s illegal invasionof Ukraine and weaponisation of gas supplies. This will ensure that energycompanies contribute to the UK’s collective efforts to strengthen public ﬁnances,and fund cost of living support and public services. We will keep the investmentlandscape for renewables under review to ensure we can deliver the capacityneeded to decarbonise the sector.
64. We are also committed to ensuring that efforts to shift UK industry towardsgreener practices are not undermined by carbon leakage; that is, the movement ofproduction and associated emissions from one country to another due to differentlevels of decarbonisation effort through carbon pricing and climate regulation.Alongside this Strategy, the government has published a consultation on a range ofdomestic policies to protect against carbon leakage and ensure UK industry has theoptimal policy environment to decarbonise. These include a carbon borderadjustment mechanism (CBAM) and mandatory product standards (MPS) andthe embodied emissions data required to introduce those policies. (See Industrychapter of ‘Net Zero Growth Plan’.)
Across the maturity curve: enabling and stimulating investment into climateresilience
65. The Climate Change Committee published its ‘Investment for a well-adaptedUK’ report in February 2023 highlighting the need to mobilise a range of fundingsources to support adaptation investment[footnote 160]. The report highlights a rangeof market barriers holding back new investment, including: limitations on climaterisk information; lack of bankability of climate adaptation projects; and policy,regulatory and behavioural barriers. One of the biggest barriers to adaptationﬁnance is being able to monetise the beneﬁts of adaptation action to repay privateinvestment. We are running 2 projects seeking to address this barrier:
a. Monetising insurance beneﬁts from ﬂood resilience: Insurance is a majorpart of the ﬁnancial response to climate risk, but its viability and affordability isthreatened where risks become very high. We will explore opportunities for newﬁnancing mechanisms for facilitating insurance markets to build ﬂood resilience,where that will reduce overall costs.b.

residents in properties impacted by sea level rise, either through incentives torelocate from high-risk areas or by providing ﬁnancial protection.
3.2.3 Supporting local areas to unlock green investment opportunities66. Local authorities play an essential role to unlock the investment opportunitiesthat support the UK’s net zero, resilience and nature objectives, whilst alsosupporting local economic growth: around 80% of all the UK’s GHG emissions arepotentially within scope or inﬂuence of local authorities and they have keyresponsibilities around planning, transport and waste management[footnote 161].
67. Local authorities also have a local leadership and convening role, which meansthey can work closely with businesses and investors to encourage investment thatwould not otherwise be obtained, and making it easier for place-based investmentmodels to be developed. The UK government is working to increase the volume ofprivate sector investment activity in local green projects in the UK and support localauthorities to facilitate the generation and promotion of new investmentopportunities. This means building capacity for local authorities to attract greeninvestment for opportunities associated with places in the UK.
Building the capacity of local actors to attract green investment68. Local authorities and other local organisations can often face a lack ofresources and skills needed to develop commercially viable investmentpropositions for investors. The UK government is funding work to address thisthrough Local Net Zero Hubs, which support local authorities to develop net zeroprojects that can attract commercial investment and through the Net Zero Goplatform launched in 2022, an online resource that supports local authorities indeveloping projects through the sharing of knowledge and best practice.[footnote 162]Going forward we will continue to strengthen support to local authorities to helpthem attract private sector investment and share expertise. The UK governmentand its Local Net Zero Hubs will work with UKIB and GFI to provide expertise tolocal authorities in identifying, developing and framing commercially attractiveinvestments. (See Local Net Zero chapter in the ‘Net Zero Growth Plan’.)
69. The UK government is also providing 4 local authority areas with up to £1million each to act as trailblazers through our Local Investment in NaturalCapital (LINC) Programme. These local authorities will use the funding to buildtheir capacity to attract private investment at scale, direct it towards their localenvironmental priorities (including those identiﬁed and mapped through LocalNature Recovery Strategies), as part of their plans for economic growth, and sharelearning with other local authorities. The selected authorities are Cornwall Council,Northumberland County Council (on behalf of the Borderlands Inclusive GrowthDeal area), West Midlands Combined Authority and York and North Yorkshire.

local growth challenge: the electriﬁcation of buses; mass transit; and, place-based, low-carbon energy infrastructure. The function is building to a steadystate through 2023, offering support to authorities across the UK.The Local Government Association has released an updated version oftheir guide to green ﬁnance for local authorities.The National Parks Partnership (NPP) and National Association forAreas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (NAAONB) to support capacitybuilding of Protected Landscape bodies and increase pipelines of projects forprivate investment. National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty(AONBs) cover nearly 25% of land in England and are critical to attractinginvestment into natural capital in a way that protects habitats for nature whileenabling access for people.We are working with the Ecosystems Knowledge Network and GreenFinance Institute (GFI) to publicise and share cases studies and learningfrom the Natural Environment Investment Readiness Fund (NEIRF). TheGreen Finance Institute has drawn on the learnings from NEIRF projects todevelop an Investment Readiness Toolkit, that provides an online frameworkto support the development of nature-based projects and improving theirinvestment readiness. We will consider options for continuing our investmentreadiness support for nature projects beyond the current iteration of theNEIRF, drawing on the results of an independent evaluation of theprogramme.Innovate UK’s £60 million place-based net zero programme Net ZeroLiving is designed to ensure UK places and communities thrive as part ofthe transition. It will address key non-technical barriers to the adoption anddeployment of locally-appropriate solutions across the UK, such as ﬁnance,helping innovative businesses to prosper and communities to thrive.
Government and public sector levers to mobilise private sector investmentlocally70. The UK government and other public institutions haves launched a range ofschemes that use public funding and ﬁnance to mobilise private sectorinvestment in local places. Through these levers we will continue to support localauthorities to support the scaling and deployment of key sectors and technologiesfor our net zero, nature, and resilience objectives. For example:
a. As announced in the Budget, new Investment Zones will drive localeconomic growth. Green business sectors are one of the 5 priority sectors forthe Investment Zones and all Investment Zones are also required todemonstrate their contribution to national net zero and environmental targets.b. Building on the LEVI Pilot and initial capability funding, the Local ElectricVehicle Infrastructure (LEVI) fund supports electric vehicle (EV) charginginfrastructure proposals led by local authorities (see Transport chapter of theNet Zero Growth Plan). The LEVI Fund is providing a further £343 millioncapital and £37.8 million resource funding to support local authorities to workwith industry and transform the availability of charging infrastructure for drivers

without off-street parking. This will enable strategic and best practice localprovision of public E V infrastructure.c. UKIB plays an important role in catalysing local government support for thenet zero transition. UKIB’s local authority function will lend up to £4 billion tolocal authorities at a preferential rate (gilts + 60bps) for high value and strategicprojects of at least £5 million.
Developing new approaches to local green ﬁnance71. We also recognise that there is an opportunity to support innovations in place-based investment models which can support local authorities to attract investment.These can build on the learnings of ‘blended ﬁnance’ models (see section 3.2.2).The UK government and other public institutions are supporting several initiativesto promote this at a local level:
a. The UK government has funded a 3Ci project to develop a business modelfor increasing private-sector investment in local net zero projects.b. The Impact Investing Institute is working with Wakeﬁeld Council on aplace-based impact investing pilot, to support the Council to develop a projectpipeline of local investment opportunities and support engagement withpotential investors.c. The exploration of Smart Local Energy Systems (SLES) as part of theUKRI’s Prospering from the Energy Revolution programme aims to bringtogether different energy assets and infrastructure, making them operate in asmarter way, to help local places reduce carbon emissions more quickly andmore cost effectively.d. As part of the Prime Minister’s Business Council convened in 2022, LloydsBanking Group, Octopus Energy, Shell and National Grid launched a LocalLow Carbon Accelerator partnership to provide a blueprint for local authoritiesand the private sector to work together and deliver green infrastructure. UKIBhave supported its projects, providing expert advice throughout the process.
72. The UK government will continue to support new and innovative approaches tolocal green ﬁnance, including opportunities for blended ﬁnance in place-basedapproaches. Work is underway through the Local Net Zero Forum to developmodels for how place-based approaches to net zero can work, and how blendingpublic and private sector ﬁnance can contribute to these, which will inform ourpolicy and programme development.
73. Councils have in recent years started issuing Community MunicipalInvestments through the Abundance platform, allowing communities to invest innet zero projects in their area. This complements opportunities for local authoritiesto beneﬁt from UKIB’s dedicated lending offer for net zero projects as well as toborrow from markets through Green and Sustainable Bonds. This represents apotentially important new source of funding for local projects and the UKgovernment is exploring ways to support the growth of the Municipal Green Bondmarket.
74. We also recognise the continued importance of local authorities inincorporating climate adaptation and resilience considerations as a priority

within local delivery of green investment. This includes considering resilience withinlocal net zero ambitions and climate mitigation projects, as well as natural capitalprojects.
3.2.4 Maintaining an attractive business and investment environment75. The UK is an attractive investment destination (see Figure 8). We have the jointmost generous capital allowance regime in the OECD covering capitalallowances as well as generous R&D and patent tax reliefs. This includes a policyof full expensing from 1 April 2023, which will provide continuity of tax relief forbusinesses. Following our exit from the European Union we also have the UK-EUTrade Cooperation Agreement, which allows zero tariff market access with the EU,while further UK Free Trade Agreements are turbocharging exports to the rest ofthe world (currently 70 plus EU).
76. In addition, we announced that from April 2023 the rate of the Research &Development Expenditure Credit (RDEC) will be increased from 13% to 20%.This means that the UK’s R&D tax relief for large companies has the joint highestuncapped headline rate in the G7.[footnote 163] Further, from April 2023, a higherrate of relief for loss-making R&D intensive SMEs will be introduced. Eligiblecompanies will receive £27 from HMRC for every £100 of R&D investment.
77. The UK also provides a series of location-based incentives to stimulate trade,investment, innovation and job creation in Freeports across the country – that is inareas near shipping ports or airports.[footnote 164] Our Freeports model includes acomprehensive package of measures, comprising tax reliefs, customs, businessrates retention, planning, regeneration, innovation and trade and investmentsupport. These are essential levers to secure investment in key infrastructureneeded for our net zero, resilience and nature objectives. The UK has announcedthe creation of 8 Freeports in England in East Midlands, Felixstowe and Harwich,the Humber, Liverpool City Region, Plymouth and South Devon, Solent, Teessideand the Thames, 2 Green Freeports in Scotland in Firth of Forth Green andInverness and Cromarty Firth, and 2 in Wales in Anglesey, and Port Talbot andMilford Haven.

78. The transition to a greener, more resilient economy has the potential to createsigniﬁcant export opportunities for the UK, which is both a growth opportunity andsupports the global transition to a net zero, resilient and nature positive economy.Attracting the investment needed to accelerate the deployment and build the supplychains of low carbon technologies has the potential to anchor these industries inthe UK, boosting export capability. Exports can enhance the growth potential of UKbusinesses, making them more attractive to investors.
79. Exports within low carbon and renewable energy industries are growingsigniﬁcantly faster than exports from the broader economy. In 2021, it is estimatedexports from these sectors increased by 67% from 2020, compared to total exportswhich increased by 6%.[footnote 165] Currently, our exports are strongest within moreestablished green sectors, such as low emission vehicles and offshore wind, butdriving investment into and growing emerging sectors could unlock signiﬁcantopportunities. For example, exports from CCUS could be worth an estimated £4.3billion in GVA by 2050.[footnote 166]
80. The UK government has ambitious goals for boosting exports, which aresupported by UK Export Finance (UKEF). UKEF is an important enabler formobilising private investment for the net zero transition by de-risking projects andﬁnance, and helping green economy exporters seize export opportunities andattract investment.
Box 25: UK Export Finance
UKEF’s mission is to advance prosperity by ensuring no viable UK export failsfor lack of ﬁnance and insurance, doing that sustainably and at no net cost tothe taxpayer. Alongside this Strategy the Chancellor has announced anincrease in UKEF’s capacity from £50 billion to £60 billion to support UKexporters and supply chains, and UKEF is committed to increasing its supportin clean growth and climate adaptation. In 2021 to 2022, the economic impactof UKEF support was up to £4.3 billion of UK Gross Value Added (GVA) and anestimated up to 72,000 UK jobs - 40,000 directly employed by exporters and afurther 32,000 jobs supported indirectly through the UK supply chain[footnote167].
In 2021, UKEF published its Climate Change Strategy for 2021 to 2024 inwhich it committed to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 across itsportfolio and operations, and providing international leadership on climatechange amongst export credit agencies and relevant ﬁnancial institutions.[footnote 168]
UKEF has a range of products to deliver its support to companies of all sizesacross the UK, helping them to access ﬁnance for their exports of goods,services and intangibles to markets around the globe. In addition, it providesoverseas partners with access to ﬁnance for projects where they commit tosourcing goods and services from the UK. UKEF is using a range of levers tosupport UK export potential and capability:

UKEF has put in place a £2 billion clean growth direct lending facilitydedicated to ﬁnancing clean growth projects overseas that contain UK exportcontent.UKEF has a domestic product range to help UK exporters and investorsrealise the opportunities of green trade. Its Export Development Guarantee(EDG) helps companies who export from, or plan to export from, the UK toaccess high value working capital loan facilities over £25 million, activelysupporting investment into UK supply chains, enabling them to seize newglobal export opportunities and establishing UK suppliers in new net zerosectors and those where the UK does not currently have a dominant globalexport position.UKEF also offers transition ﬁnance to support UK companies that are activelyworking to transition their business away from fossil fuels. This includes aTransition Export Development Guarantee for companies that candemonstrate via a Climate Transition Plan that they are Paris-aligned andtransitioning away from business activities in the overseas fossil fuel sector.UKEF has also supported a number of Sustainability-Linked Loans (SLLs)through its EDG product, including in the aviation, construction andmanufacturing sectors. These loans provide favourable terms should acompany meet pre-agreed sustainability targets which are ambitious andrelevant to the borrower’s business (that is reducing emissions), encouragingtheir achievement of positive sustainability outcomes.
3.3 Working with the business and investment community
3.3.1 Promoting investment opportunities81. The UK government has an important role to play in supporting the privatesector to identify investment opportunities. Stakeholder feedback has indicated thatwhilst there is available capital to be invested in green projects, more can be doneto improve the visibility of projects that require investment and support all stages ofthe project development life cycle. We understand the importance of developing apositive feedback loop between government, businesses and investors about keyinvestment opportunities, streamlining information ﬂows and enhancing investorconﬁdence.
82. The UK government works with the private sector to source and help promoteexciting green projects and investment opportunities to interested investors. We dothis by advertising investible propositions in locations across the UK, and bydirectly connecting investors to investment opportunities.
83. We advertise and promote investment opportunities through:
a. The Investment Atlas platform: The Investment Atlas[footnote 169] is the UKgovernment’s online catalogue of priority investment opportunities, from acrossinvestment types and covering the whole of the UK. The Atlas enables investorsto ﬁnd information quickly and access expertise. On the Investment Atlas, we

have 41 green related speciﬁc investment opportunities across our HighPotential Opportunities, Large Capital Investment Opportunities and Freeports.Additionally, we have 14 sector overviews with a green focus on the Atlas. FromOctober 2021 to January 2023, the Investment Atlas had over 100,000 uniquevisitors and over 500,000 page views.b. Promoting UK green investment opportunities: We build on this withdirect engagement with the investment community, for example through eventssuch as the Green Trade and Investment Expo, which was held on 1 November2022 in Gateshead. This event brought together 200 British business leadersand global investors, showcasing investment and export opportunitiespresented by the UK’s net zero transition. In September this year thegovernment will also host the Global Investment Summit 2023. This will build onthe Global Investment Summit held in 2021, at which government announcednearly £10 billion of new foreign direct investments in the UK.[footnote 170]
84. The UK government can also help promote exciting green projects byconnecting investment opportunities to interested investors through:
a. Our Ofﬁce for Investment provides a single front door to the UKgovernment for high-value and high-impact domestic and internationalinvestors, facilitating and helping the UK to win green inward investmentsthrough a concierge offer.[footnote 171] The Ofﬁce for Investment works closelywith regional and national stakeholders to source investment opportunitiesacross the UK, and promotes these with both sovereign and domesticinstitutional investors to drive increased investment in line with thegovernment’s net zero agenda.b. Our Venture Capital Unit works to develop long-term relationships withglobal corporate and venture capital investors, attracting investment into UKcompanies.[footnote 172] The Unit promotes leading start-ups at showcaseevents, organises roundtables at UK Embassies and introduces pre-screenedcompanies to known investors via sector brochures and single deals.
Box 26: Venture Capital Unit
Over the past 7 years, the Venture Capital Unit has facilitated £5 billion of VCinvestment into UK start-ups. Net Zero investment is a key focus for the Unit,and this year it is running its second Green Builders of Tomorrow competition,in conjunction with Octopus Investments. It is open to early-stage companiesseeking to raise £5 million - £100 million during 2023, and targets investors inthe UAE and across the Middle East.
3.3.2 Engaging the business and investment community85. Beyond investment promotion, the right channels of communication andengagement between government, businesses and investors are needed to ensurethat policies are effective, market barriers are addressed efﬁciently, and all partiescan build their approach to the transition to a net zero economy in lockstep.Government is establishing a new partnership to work with business and ﬁnance

leaders to support the delivery of our net zero target - a new Net Zero Businessand Investment Group.
86. The group will look to develop a shared view of market barriers across differentsectors to deliver net zero and the respective roles across government, industryand the ﬁnance sector in addressing these. It will also look at identifying the keypolicy support, information and advice businesses (including SMEs) require in theirtransition. The work of the group will be complimentary to that of other existingtaskforces supported by government and a wide range of stakeholders will overtime be invited to get involved in the work of the group as its focus evolves. The fullcomposition of the Leadership Group and Secretariat for the group will beannounced in the near future.
87. This continues our commitment to working closely with the investment andbusiness community, as has been exempliﬁed by the Green Finance Institute (GFI).The GFI was launched in 2019 with seed funding by the UK government and aimsto support the mainstreaming of green ﬁnance both in the UK and overseas. Itsstrategy has been to identify the barriers to investment in real economydecarbonization by sector and committing to develop the solutions to overcomethem, and in doing so the Institute has become a valued partner for marketparticipants and policy makers.
Box 27: Green Finance Institute
Since launching the GFI has carried out high proﬁle and impactful work acrossa number of strategic areas. The GFI is now moving from start-up to scale-up,growing its sector pilots into market-wide ﬁnancial solutions in the builtenvironment and road transport. It will expand into new sectors, includingsustainable aviation, carbon capture and storage, and harder to abateindustrials. The GFI will also continue to help develop the market for investmentinto nature.
Examples of recent and active projects include:
Built environment: Launching the Coalition for the Energy Efﬁciency ofBuildings (CEEB) to support development of green ﬁnancial products,developing Green Home Finance Principles which one third of the UKmortgage market has already committed to align with.Road transport: Working with over 230 industry organisations to identify thechallenges and opportunities for investors in electric vehicle (EV) charginginfrastructure, consumer access, heavy goods vehicles and the batterysupply chain.Nature: Supporting the Natural Environment Investment Readiness Fund(NEIRF) and the subsequent Facility for Investment Ready Nature inScotland (FIRNS), advising and hosting the secretariat for the group andlaunching GFI Hive[footnote 173] , an online knowledge sharing platform oninvestment in nature.Local investment: Leading research into barriers faced by local authoritiesto attract investment and co-leading the Local Climate Bond Campaign,

3.4 Unlocking high-integrity carbon and nature markets
88. The UK has been a pioneer in the use of market mechanisms to mobiliseﬁnance for climate and nature since 2002, when we established Europe’s ﬁrstEmissions Trading Scheme (ETS). Today our goal is to make the UK ETS theworld’s ﬁrst net zero consistent cap and trade market. Internationally, we are aleading supporter of carbon pricing and market uptake in emerging markets anddeveloping economies, having helped over 30 to put a price on their own emissionsthrough carbon taxes, ETSs and offset mechanisms. As well helping to direct localﬁnance towards cleaner development, this enhanced capacity can facilitateparticipation in international carbon markets.
89. Demand is increasing from the private sector for high-integrity markets thatallow organisations to purchase high quality credits for carbon and otherecosystems services. The UK government is committed to fostering growth in thesemarkets in a way that is high-integrity, unlocks truly additional ﬁnance for net zero,and takes advantage of the synergies between carbon and other ecosystemservices, such as biodiversity, water or ﬂood mitigation, to unlock additionalinvestment in nature.
3.4.1 Voluntary carbon markets90. Voluntary carbon markets (VCMs) enable carbon credits to be purchased,usually by organisations, for use against voluntary climate commitments, asopposed to legally binding emissions reduction obligations. VCMs have grownrapidly in recent years from around $300 million in 2019 to $2 billion in 2021[footnote174], fuelled by an increase in net zero commitments made by non-state actors.Further progress was made at COP26, including through agreement on theframework and rules for international carbon trading under Article 6 of the ParisAgreement.
91. Financial institutions and other stakeholders have highlighted a number ofchallenges that could prevent V C Ms from reaching their potential. These includethe need for clarity on what constitutes a good quality credit, how credits should beused when claiming the achievement of private sector net zero targets, relevantdisclosure and assurance processes, the need for common international standardsand principles, and the need for clarity on a range of regulatory matters. Whilst it is

Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
important that the market is able to innovate, there is a clear appetite for UKgovernment action to ensure the market grows in a manner that providesassurance on integrity. This includes considering targeted regulatory interventionswhere these will help the market play a greater role in the transition to net zero andensure companies are not incentivised to use credits as an alternative to takingaction on their own internal emissions.
92. More is needed to build international consensus on VCMs, including theirinteractions with Article 6. The Voluntary Carbon Markets Initiative (VCMI) andthe Integrity Council on Voluntary Carbon Markets (VCMI), created throughinternational multistakeholder processes during the UK’s COP26 Presidency, arestriving to tackle many of these challenges by providing greater clarity on thedeﬁnition of high-integrity VCMs. Both initiatives will publish their guidance thisyear; the UK government will consider the potential for their outputs to serve as abasis for international best practice on market integrity, and the extent to which theycould be incorporated within relevant regulatory regimes, including through theconsultation set out in section 3.4.3. The UK government has conﬁrmed itsintention to position the UK as a global hub for trading in voluntary carbon markets,and is grateful for the work of the UK VCM Forum and its chair, Dame Clara Furse,to this end.
3.4.2 Nature Markets93. Nature markets enable farmers and natural resource managers to sell carbonand other ecosystem services – the beneﬁts provided by nature – throughsustainable management and nature restoration projects. Nature markets may bevoluntary or driven by regulatory obligations. They include VCMs such as the UKWoodland Carbon Code and UK Peatland Code, and other emerging naturemarkets such as Biodiversity Net Gain in England. Further opportunities exist inmarkets still in development such as for blue carbon, see below.
94. Nature markets need to grow rapidly to attract investment at the scale requiredto achieve our net zero and environmental targets. The UK government iscommitted to supporting the development of markets for carbon and otherecosystem services in the UK, guiding, and stimulating demand while also ensuringthat they build trust and conﬁdence.
95. We are supporting market participants to develop and converge aroundcommon, trusted standards and processes which will ensure integrity. With the rightpolicy guardrails, the growth of nature markets can represent a triple win: deliveringfor the climate and the environment; providing vital revenue streams to ﬁnance farmbusinesses and nature recovery; and enabling responsible ﬁrms to meet their netzero and environmental obligations and commitments transparently and efﬁciently.
96. As announced at Budget 2023, the UK government is exploring elements of thetax treatment of ecosystem service markets and environmental land management.This includes a call for evidence published on the 15 March 2023 on the taxtreatment of the production and sale of ecosystem service units. The aim is tounderstand the commercial operations and the areas of uncertainty in respect oftaxation.

Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
Box 28: Peatland Code update
The Peatland Code and UK Saltmarsh Code are voluntary certiﬁcationstandards for UK peatland restoration projects, providing a consistent approachfor projects wishing to attract carbon ﬁnance. We recently funded theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), UK Centre for Ecology &Hydrology (UKCEH) and the James Hutton Institute to expand the Code to asigniﬁcantly larger area of England’s peat. This will help facilitate more privateinvestment into peatland restoration.
97. We are also supporting innovation to develop and pilot new nature markets.Our Natural Environment Investment Readiness Fund (NEIRF) is supporting thedevelopment of 86 nature projects across England to generate revenue from naturemarkets and operate on repayable private sector investment. Projects will eithermonetise the beneﬁts of nature or develop tools or standards to help others to doso. We will consider options for continuing our investment readiness support fornature projects beyond the current iteration of the NEIRF, drawing on the results ofan independent evaluation of the programme.
Box 29: Supporting farmers to participate in nature markets
As custodians of over 70% of UK land, farmers will be key to the success ofnature markets, and we are committed to ensuring they can access thesemarkets. A recent report from the GFI’s Farming and Finance working group on‘Financing a Farming Transition’, identiﬁes barriers and corresponding enablersunder the themes of Data, Priority Environmental Outcomes, EnvironmentalMarkets Principles and Aggregation Models. The UK government will progresswork in each of these areas, including through actions set out in this Strategy –and we have commissioned the GFI to develop an online toolkit this year tohelp farmers identify and navigate opportunities to access private sectorinvestment to pay for nature positive outcomes.
Environmental Farmers’ Group – a collaborative aggregation model
Aggregating supply is key for attracting investment into natural capital. TheNatural Environment Investment Readiness Fund (NEIRF) has awardedfunding to the Environmental Farmers Group (EFG), a natural capital tradingco-operative that operates across several farmer clusters in the Avoncatchment. It aims to facilitate access for its 75 farmer members to privatenature markets, providing a fair ﬁnancial return on restoring their natural capitalthrough the sale of biodiversity units, nutrient offsets and carbon credits.
EFG’s aggregation model provides an opportunity for organisations looking forlarge-scale environmental trades to deal with a single body. In order to developscale and ensure the inclusion of smaller farms, equalisation is built into themember contracts so that 88% of a trade will go to the member farm providing

the ecosystem service/environmental outcome, while 9% is shared with thefarms in the catchment area. The remainder pays for EFG’s operating costs.
3.4.3 Accelerating Market Development98. The UK government will act to unlock the potential of high-integrity voluntarycarbon and nature markets to contribute to net zero and wider environmentalimprovement. We will consult later this year on speciﬁc steps and interventionsneeded to mobilise additional ﬁnance through high-integrity voluntary markets andprotect against the risk of greenwashing. This will be guided by the principles that:
a. Interventions across government and the private sector should create acohesive regime for unlocking capital, with voluntary markets effectivelyintegrated into the long-term strategy for ﬁnancial disclosure and transitionplanning;b. Regulatory responsibilities should be clariﬁed, and regulations introduced in aproportionate manner where there is clear evidence that doing so wouldimprove the integrity and scale of the UK market; andc. High-integrity voluntary markets should be encouraged, with the rightprinciples and transparency to protect investors and consumers, ensureadditionality towards net zero and the environment, and where appropriate seekto maximise synergies between carbon and nature markets.
99. This consultation will respond to key recommendations of the independent NetZero Review and the ﬁndings of the CCC’s report on Voluntary Carbon Markets andOffsetting. Recognising the interconnectedness of global carbon markets, it willbuild on the work of key international initiatives (see section 3.4.1) to developguidance for best practice in the international market and consider how theirﬁndings should be applied in the context of the UK market and regulatory regime,including to ensure a coherent approach across carbon and other nature markets.
100. The Transition Plan Taskforce will provide clarity on the use of high-integrityVCMs within its framework, aligning with international best practice. We willcontinue to work with leading stakeholders to address remaining uncertainties onthe interface between VCMs and Article 6 and promote consensus on best practicefor high-integrity VCMs through multilateral international fora.
101. We are publishing alongside this Strategy the ﬁrst Nature Markets Framework.This sets out principles and priorities for the development of mechanisms forinvestment in ecosystem services - including carbon removal and storage,biodiversity and water quality - and aims to clarify how farmers and naturalresource managers can engage in nature market to unlock these opportunities.
102. At the core of this framework is the principle of environmental integrity. It buildson experience and lessons learned from the development of the UK WoodlandCarbon Code and UK Peatland Code as well as emerging international bestpractice, such as that being developed by VCMI and VCMI. It also provides furtherdetails on how revenue streams from multiple nature markets and public grants

such as Environmental Land Management schemes can be combined or ‘stacked’to make it easier to ﬁnance genuinely ambitious, multifunctional land use patterns.
103. The Framework also sets out our plans for the British Standards Institution towork with business, ﬁnance, farming and environmental experts to develop acomprehensive suite of nature investment standards.[footnote 175]
104. Finally, we recognise the integrity offered by the UK ETS could unlockinvestment at scale in the UK’s greenhouse gas removal sector by proving anintegrated market where businesses can make economically efﬁcient choices onhow to decarbonise or remove their emissions. We will work with the UK ETSAuthority to consider options for integrating greenhouse gas removals in the UKETS, subject to the outcomes of last year’s UK ETS consultation, a robustMonitoring, Reporting and Veriﬁcation regime being in place, and the managementof wider impacts - including market stability and the permanence of the emissionsstored by the greenhouse gas removal technologies. Further detail will be providedin the government response to the ETS consultation.
Box 30: Blue carbon - opportunities to boost investment in our marineenvironment
Certain marine and coastal habitats capture and store carbon dioxide. Theseblue carbon habitats are richly biodiverse ecosystems that provide a crucialbuffer from coastal ﬂooding, beneﬁt long term ﬁsh stocks and improve waterquality. The UK government supports the development of blue carbon andecosystem markets as one means to help mobilise the ﬁnance required for bluecarbon habitat creation and restoration. We will ensure that blue carbonmarkets are developed and implemented in line with agreed principles thatensure robustness, market credibility and efﬁciency. Codes or standards forclaiming blue carbon credits are still in early stages of development in the UK.Our Natural Environment Investment Readiness Fund is supporting projectslooking into this, including almost £300k of grants to measure and verify thecarbon storage potential in saltmarshes, which will help leverage privateinvestment into these important habitats.
3.5 Beyond the UK: Supporting green investment inemerging markets and developing economies
105. The need to develop effective enabling environments, build capabilities in keyinstitutions, develop bankable project pipelines and deploy public resourceseffectively to mobilise private investment at scale are common challenges faced byall countries.The UK’s green ﬁnance expertise, the strengths of the City of Londonand our strong track record in delivering innovative climate ﬁnance provide anopportunity to work with our partner countries to tackle the structural challengesthey face in unlocking green investment.
106. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) March 2023Synthesis Report shows, limiting warming to 1.5°C to 2°C above pre-industrial

levels will require a 3-to-6-fold increase on current levels of climate changemitigation investment to 2030, with investment to emerging markets and developingeconomies (EMDEs) a critical enabler to closing this investment gap.[footnote 176]Separate analysis shows that to achieve climate and nature goals, EMDEs(excluding China) will require over $1 trillion per year in external investment by2030.177 The ﬁnancial sector has a huge role to play in meeting this challenge andall major ﬁnancial centres will be considering how they can contribute.
107. Our actions in Chapter 2 to align the ﬁnancial system are pre-requisites forunlocking this growth, with our actions to green the UK ﬁnancial sector helpingunlock green investment well beyond our borders. In tandem, the UK InternationalClimate Finance (ICF) Strategy sets out our full approach to deploying publicclimate ﬁnance to projects and investment on the ground.
108. Complementing those approaches, this section sets out how the UK willmobilise green investment into EMDEs through:
a. Country partnerships and building capability – building long-termrelationships to exchange learning, support national planning processes, anddevelop project pipelines.b. Strategic public investment and enhancing the scale of investmentopportunities – mobilising private investment through blended ﬁnancestructures and supporting access to large‑scale investment, such as throughissuance of green and sustainable bonds.c. Innovative approaches to unlock private capital – building on theingenuity of the UK ﬁnancial sector to adopt and scale innovative ﬁnancialinstruments, including by establishing high‑integrity carbon markets anddeveloping listed products.d. Global impact through reform of the international ﬁnancial architecture– reforming international ﬁnancial institutions to work better with the privatesector and deliver greater impact in meeting the climate and nature investmentchallenge.e. Enabling private investment in international climate adaptation –providing ﬁnancial support and building coalitions to address the barriers toprivate investment in adaptation and resilience.

British International Investment (BII)
BII is the UK’s Development Finance Institution (DFI), investing in private ﬁrmsin ODA-eligible countries in Africa and South Asia, and expanding through aphased approach to the Indo-Paciﬁc and the Caribbean.
UK Export Finance (UKEF)
UKEF is the UK’s Export Credit Agency (ECA) and in 2022 was ranked as theworld’s top E C A for sustainable ﬁnancing, with over £3.6 billion awarded toclean energy, healthcare and critical infrastructure projects in 2021. [footnote 178]
International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and multilateral climate andenvironment funds
IFIs refers to multilateral development banks (MDBs) and the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF), in which the UK is a major shareholder. The UK is also amajor donor to multilateral climate and environment funds such as the GreenClimate Fund (GCF), Global Environment Facility (GEF) and ClimateInvestment Funds (CIF).
3.5.1 Country partnerships and building capability109. Mobilising green ﬁnance at scale requires clear country or regional strategiesto meet climate and nature objectives, accompanied by strong pipelines ofinvestment opportunities. The UK will continue working with partner countries todevelop these approaches, including sharing knowledge and expertise we havegathered from our domestic action. This will help raise global ambition, accelerateinvestment, and build lasting capability and partnerships between public and privateﬁnancial institutions. It will also create effective public policy which provides long-term market conﬁdence and lower risk for investors.
110. Through the UK’s ICF, we will continue to develop and implement capacitybuilding instruments in support of these goals. Key current programmes include:
a. UK Partnering for Accelerated Climate Transitions (UK PACT) supportscountries to put in place the building blocks for mobilising ﬁnance throughcountry programmes, skill-shares, secondments and other technical assistance.b. Through our co-chairing of the NDC Partnership we have helped put inplace a ﬁnance strategy to support investment in countries’ nationallydetermined contributions (NDCs).c. The UK’s Climate Finance Accelerator (CFA) helps countries developbankable project pipelines while identifying suitable ﬁnancing options. Theprogramme operates in 9 countries[footnote 179] and convenes projectdevelopers, ﬁnanciers and policymakers in capacity building workshops. TheCFA has supported 111 low carbon projects with a potential total value of

around $2.3 billion, representing a material and direct contribution to projectsand programmes in EMDEs.d. The Nature Positive Economy Programme was launched in 2022 to meetthe growing imperative for long-term ﬁnancing strategies for nature. Theprogramme supports public and private ﬁnancial institutions in EMDEs tointegrate nature-related risks and opportunities into decision making. Thisinvolves implementing strategies, tools, and frameworks, and supportingengagement with governments on reforming environmentally harmful subsidies.Building on the Dasgupta Review, the UK’s Nature Transition SupportProgramme also supports EMDEs to analyse the relationship between natureand their economies, and will support partners to identify and implementresilient pathways for nature, people, and the economy.
111. Beyond our bi-lateral support, the UK will continue supporting efforts by MDBsto integrate climate and nature investment into national development plans, and forthe development and implementation of ambitious Long-Term Strategies for lowcarbon, climate-resilient development. This includes the World Bank’s CountryClimate and Development Reports (CCDRs), a diagnostic tool which integratesclimate and development. The UK is also the biggest contributor to the WorldBank’s Global Programme on Sustainability (GPS), which provides global andnational analysis of the value of natural capital and ecosystem services, includingrisks and opportunities for sustainable development.
112. Building on the success of our individual programmes, we are going further todevelop ambitious funding models and stronger long-term partnerships to ensureco-ordination and coherence between public and private ﬁnance on the ground.This is key for ensuring the impact of climate ﬁnance is more than the sum of itsparts. The UK will work to do this through initiatives like the Just EnergyTransition Partnerships (JETPs) for clean energy transitions and the LoweringEmissions by Accelerating Forest Finance Coalition (LEAF) for protectingtropical forests and reducing emissions from deforestation.
Box 31: Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs)
JETPs are ambitious partnerships that will deliver investment for just energytransitions away from fossil fuels in partner countries. They bring together acritical mass of development, philanthropic, private, and domestic ﬁnance toaccelerate early retirement of high-emitting assets, invest in renewable energyand related grid infrastructure, and support an inclusive and equitable transitionfor affected communities.
The ﬁrst JETP was launched with South Africa at COP26 with the UK leadingan ‘International Partners Group’ to support South Africa’s leadership, andincludes an initial $8.5 billion in public ﬁnance. At COP27, South Africapresented its JET Investment Plan, setting out the country’s investment needsto support its decarbonisation commitments and aiming to mobilise a further$98 billion – showing the investment opportunity for the private sector.

Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
JETPs have also now been launched in Indonesia (US and Japan co-lead G7engagement with the country, with UK support) with a total ﬁnance package of$20 billion, and Vietnam (UK and EU co-led) with a total ﬁnance package of$15.5 billion. As part of these ﬁnance packages, a coalition of private sectorinvestors co-ordinated by the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zerocommitted $10 billion and $7.75 billion to the Indonesia and Vienam JETPs,respectively, matching the public ﬁnance commitments for both partnerships.Discussions are ongoing to agree further JETPs with the government ofSenegal and government of India.
Alongside the aggregation of ﬁnance, the UK is supporting partner countries tomake critical policy reforms to enable private investment at scale in renewableenergy and energy efﬁciency. The UK’s immediate priority for JETPs issupporting implementation of partnerships in countries where they are alreadyunderway. This has potential to inform approaches taken elsewhere in efforts toaccelerate the transition to low carbon, inclusive economic growth.
113. Financing for the transition can further beneﬁt from dialogue betweencountries with comparable challenges and contexts. To enable this, the UK willwork through:
a. Our co-leadership of the Glasgow Breakthrough Agenda, which isaccelerating the global development and deployment of clean technologies.Launched at COP26 by 45 world leaders representing over 70% of global GDP,the Breakthroughs Agenda is driving targeted international cooperation to makeclean technologies the most affordable, accessible, and attractive choiceglobally by 2030.[footnote 180]b. The Energy Transition Council, which brings together political, ﬁnancial,and technical leadership in the power sector to make clean energy the mostaffordable and reliable option for its 11[footnote 181] partner countries. TheCouncil mobilises, tailors and coordinates international public and privateﬁnance offers to the energy transition needs of partner countries, includingthrough its Rapid Response Facility. It also improves the timing and relevanceof assistance provided by participating institutions including internationaldonors, multilateral development banks, philanthropies and technical agencies.c. The International Just Transition Declaration which the UK broughtforward at COP26, and for the ﬁrst time sets out how countries providingclimate ﬁnance would ensure that their international support is playing its part tocreate good, green jobs around the world. At COP26 the Declaration wassigned by 18 donor countries, covering a signiﬁcant proportion of globalinternational public ﬁnancing. The UK will continue to collaborate withinternational partners to embed these principles in our ICF and broader fundingstreams.
114. In tandem with our efforts on climate, in 2022 the UK – in collaboration withEcuador, Gabon, and the Maldives – set out a political vision for bridging the globalnature ﬁnance gap through the 10 Point Plan for Financing Biodiversity. ThePlan presents a clear pathway for bridging the global nature ﬁnance gap by deﬁning

the role of all sources of ﬁnance, with a particular focus on how international publicﬁnance can support EMDEs to accelerate the transition to become nature positive.
3.5.2 Strategic public investment and enhancing the scale of investmentopportunities115. While there is no shortage of private capital available to deliver climate andnature goals, public ﬁnance has an important role in catalysing investment andcreating markets. For this reason, the UK has worked with international partners toestablish key multilateral climate and environmental funds such as the ClimateInvestment Funds, Green Climate Fund and Global Environment Facility andis collectively one of the largest contributors to these funds. We will continue tosupport their work to deliver impact at scale, leverage private investment andmaximise value for money.
116. The UK will use its ICF strategically to incentivise and enable investments inEMDEs through a variety of ﬁnance instruments, which can be adopted byinternational partners and markets to reach scale, building on the £5.2 billion inprivate ﬁnance that UK interventions have mobilised to date.[footnote 182] Thisincludes deploying blended ﬁnance structures and tailoring them to local needs andinvestor risk-tolerance. It also includes working to enhance the scale of investmentopportunities in EMDEs to enable access to deep pools of capital from institutionalinvestors, for example through supporting issuance of green and sustainablebonds.
117. The UK has developed several vehicles to do this, including:
a. British International Investment (BII) provides capital and expertise toprivate ﬁrms in Africa and South Asia, and is now expanding to the Indo-Paciﬁcand the Caribbean. The UK government aims to deploy £200 million ofconcessional capital through BII’s new Climate Innovation Facility to invest inthe scale-up of pioneering technologies and climate solutions in markets whereprivate investors have been reluctant to take on the risk alone. B I I has alsoinvested $75 million in Africa and South Asia’s ﬁrst Green Basket Bond, a newinnovative, multi-currency, ﬁnancing structure arranged by Symbiotics, a leadingemerging markets access platform and ﬁnancial lender. The bond will ﬁnancesmall-scale green projects and businesses, funded through 10-15 micro, small,and medium enterprise (MSME) banks.b. The Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG) supports thedevelopment of sustainable infrastructure in Africa, Asia and the Indo-Paciﬁc.Underpinned by majority UK funding, PIDG has closed on 190 infrastructureprojects and mobilised $23 billion in private investment since 2002.[footnote 183]PIDG deploys a mix of technical assistance, viability gap funding and long-termdebt, and provides local currency guarantees to mobilise ﬁnance for greeninfrastructure from local pension funds and insurance companies. PIDG haspioneered development and issuance of green bonds in EMDEs, includingsupporting Vietnam’s ﬁrst onshore, internationally certiﬁed green bond. Bondproceeds will allow the issuance of longer-term loans to ﬁnance greeninfrastructure.

c. Through its investment arm, the UK-funded Financial Sector Deepening(FSD) Africa provides early-stage, risk-bearing capital to inventive ﬁnancialsector organisations to stimulate capital ﬂows in support of green economicgrowth. FSD Africa also supports issuance of green and sustainability bonds onthe continent. This includes helping Morocco’s national rail operator issueAfrica’s ﬁrst corporate clean mobility green bond to electrify the country’srailways, and supporting Kenya to issue its ﬁrst green bond.
118. Whilst strengthening trade and supply chains, UK Export Finance (UKEF) isalso playing an important role in ﬁnancing sustainable infrastructure in EMDEs. In2021 to 2022, UKEF provided £7.4 billion in support for UK exports, helping toﬁnance exports to 61 countries without any support for overseas fossil fuelsprojects.[footnote 184] This includes £3.6 billion ﬁnancing awarded to clean energy,healthcare and critical infrastructure projects, including projects in EMDEs such asCôte d’Ivoire and Türkiye. Some UKEF products include buyer ﬁnance support,which helps UK suppliers win contracts on overseas clean growth projects byproviding attractive ﬁnancing terms for overseas buyers. This includes repaymentperiods of up to 18 years in some sectors, such as renewable energy. UKEF alsooffer direct lending from a £2 billion allocation ringfenced to support projectsaligned with the International Capital Markets Association’s Green Bond Principles.
119. Despite challenges, emerging nature sectors are providing some of the mostpromising investment opportunities globally. The UK’s £100 million BiodiverseLandscapes Fund (BLF) will have a strong focus on leveraging private capital toprotect biodiversity and reduce poverty in 6 global biodiverse hotspots across 3continents. We will also leverage private investment through over £40 million ofinvestment in the Eco Business Fund and the Land Degradation NeutralityFund, which are dedicated to raising public and private capital to supportsustainable land use projects and improve biodiversity.
3.5.3 Innovative approaches to unlock private capital120. Harnessing the innovative potential of ﬁnancial markets and unlocking allavailable sources of ﬁnance will be crucial to meet climate and nature goals. TheUK will continue to support such approaches across our portfolio, working closelywith the private sector to make our public ﬁnance go further, enable innovation incapital markets, and adapt ﬁnancial instruments in response to the speciﬁcchallenges of climate and nature ﬁnancing. This includes:
a. Through the new Climate Investment Funds Capital Market Mechanism(CCMM). This new fund is expected to issue green bonds in the region of $5-7billion through the London Stock Exchange for EMDEs to develop cleantechnologies at scale, which in turn is anticipated to leverage 10 times theamount in co-ﬁnancing at the project level. It will use returns from historicinvestments through the Climate Investment Funds (CIFs), to which the UK isthe largest contributor, having provided £2.7 billion.b. New solutions to help countries leverage the potential of capital markets,including through the Mobilising Institutional Capital Through ListedProduct Structures (MOBILIST) programme. MOBILIST uses UK funds on

Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
commercial terms to enable EMDEs to list on public markets like the LondonStock Exchange. For example, a UK investment of £24.5 million throughMOBILIST resulted in an IPO of £115 million for Thomas Lloyd Energy ImpactInvestment Trust to invest in renewable energy in Asia.c. The use of results-based payments, using learning developed throughprogrammes such as the Transformative Carbon Asset Facility, Ci-Dev andour support for REDD+, can optimise performance of climate projects by linkingpayment to outcomes. We are already using lessons from these programmes toinform approaches to high-integrity carbon credits, and they offer the potentialto inform development of sustainability-linked ﬁnancing products, which are ofincreasing interest to the private sector.d. Innovating and championing new debt arrangements that enable vulnerablecountries to invest without the risk of being unable to service their debts in theevent of climate impacts. In response to calls from many vulnerable countries tointroduce climate resilient debt clauses (CRDCs), to pause debt repaymentwhen climate shocks or natural disasters hit, the UK announced that UK ExportFinance will be the world’s ﬁrst export credit agency to offer CRDCs in directsovereign lending. The UK has also published principles for including CRDCs inprivate sector loans and is calling on more international ﬁnancial institutions(IFIs) and the private sector to adopt them.
121. We are also working to identify, develop and scale early stage ﬁnancialproducts and practices to meet EMDE needs and mobilise private investment,including for nature ﬁnance. This includes:
a. The Global Innovation Lab for Climate Finance, a public-privatepartnership that mobilises ﬁnance for ﬁnancially innovative ideas, making theminvestable and ready to implement. 62 projects supported to date havemobilised $3.5 billion in sustainable investment.[footnote 185] The UK is workingwith the Lab to scope new support for projects in Latin America, including apotential thematic window to identify innovative ﬁnancing solutions forhigh‑integrity forests.b. Our new £65.5 million Accelerate-to-Demonstrate (A2D) Facility, deliveredin partnership with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization(UNIDO) will drive forward the clean energy transition in EMDEs throughinnovative technologies and the business models needed to deploy them. Thisis an expansion of our Clean Energy Innovation Facility, which since 2019 hasleveraged around £40 million in direct private investment in EMDEs. We willcontinue to broaden this portfolio and look to bring in additional internationalpartners over time.c. The UK’s £500 million Blue Planet Fund (BPF) supports EMDEs to reducepoverty, protect and sustainably manage their marine resources and addresshuman- generated threats. Programmes under the BPF include technicalassistance to support blue bond development and funding for innovativeﬁnancial tools that encourage private investment into marine nature-basedsolutions.d. The UK’s Biodiversity Challenge Funds (the Darwin Initiative, IllegalWildlife Trade Challenge Fund, and Darwin Plus) award grants to support

the development and adoption of ﬁnancial mechanisms to beneﬁt biodiversity,people and the planet. This includes soil carbon credits to support conservationof savanna in Tanzania, insurance for villagers in areas of Human WildlifeConﬂict in Nepal, and payments for water to support conservation of tropicalforest in Bolivia. To support the mobilisation of ﬁnancial resources in pursuit ofTarget 19 of the GBF, we will also investigate further innovative mechanisms tofund biodiversity, including biodiversity credits.
122. In addition, carbon markets are a signiﬁcant potential source of untappedﬁnance for EMDEs which offer the potential to lower the cost of the transition.Under the UK COP26 Presidency, agreement on global carbon trading rules(‘Article 6’) was reached after many years of negotiations, providing a basis forinternational norms and standards to unlock ﬁnance whilst providing assurance onenvironmental integrity. As we take forward action to implement Article 6 and awaitthe ﬁndings of voluntary market initiatives such as VCMI and IC-VCM (see section3.4), we will aim to strengthen the international consensus needed to unlock a trulyglobal market, provide social protections and avoid greenwashing. This will includeworking with VCMI to take forward Country Contact Groups to enhance access forEMDEs.
123. The UK government is one of the largest providers of capacity building supportfor EMDEs seeking to participate in carbon markets and has committed over £650million to funds supporting carbon markets and results-based payments.[footnote 186]As we consider future interventions, the UK will look to ensure coherence incapacity building measures across both voluntary and compliance markets,including working through the Article 6 Implementation Partnership to improvecoherence of capacity building efforts. We will work with delivery partners andEMDEs to ensure collaboration with the private sector in delivering high-integritymarkets. In addition, we will work to establish complementarity betweenhigh‑integrity markets for voluntary and compliance purposes, and between thosefor climate and other environmental services; and to ensure indigenous people andlocal communities are protected.
3.5.4 Global impact through reform of the international ﬁnancial architecture124. International Financial Institutions are a major source of support to emergingmarkets and developing economies (EMDEs), with MDBs having provided $51billion in climate ﬁnance in 2021.[footnote 187] In line with decisions at COP27, theUK will champion and target speciﬁc reforms of the international ﬁnancial system tomake it stronger. We will use our inﬂuence in these institutions to drive mobilisationat the scale needed to meet climate and environmental challenges. This includesleading the response to the Bridgetown Initiative, the World Bank EvolutionRoadmap and the G20 MDB Capital Adequacy Framework Review. Combinedwith our efforts to green the ﬁnancial system and enhance the effectiveness of theclimate funds, this will be critical in ensuring an international system that is able todeliver better for EMDEs.
125. By implementing the recommendations of the G20 MDB Capital AdequacyFramework Review, MDB balance sheets could be used to release billions of

14/10/2023, 16:24
Mobilising green investment: 2023 green ﬁnance strategy - GOV.UK
dollars of additional ﬁnance for EMDEs. The UK is leading in delivering some of therecommendations. For example, since COP 26 we have announced UK guaranteesto expand MDB lending by over $5 billion, including to support Just EnergyTransition Partnerships, such as through the $2 billion Room to Run guaranteefor the African Development Bank (AfDB), developed in partnership with the Kinsurance industry. We expect to further scale up our guarantee portfolio in future.
126. Directing Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) to deliver on the globalcommitment – ﬁrst made by G7 Leaders in the UK – to channel $100 billion ofSDRs to vulnerable countries, could be signiﬁcantly aided by MDB capabilities. Weare exploring the possibility of channelling some SDRs to the African DevelopmentBank through a hybrid capital instrument which would allow the Bank to leverage itby 3 to 4 times, potentially becoming a model for other MDBs.
127. Due to their geographical reach, ﬁnancial expertise and inﬂuence, MDBs havesigniﬁcant potential to scale up private ﬁnance mobilisation, building onapproaches we already know work. In particular we will support MDBs to developinnovative new investment vehicles which provide the scale and diversiﬁcation toattract institutional investors, scale-up support for green capital marketdevelopment, support the expansion of specialist infrastructure platforms, anddeliver strategies for scaling their use of risk transfer as recommended by the G20MDB Capital Adequacy Framework Review.
128. The UK will support efforts to increase shock-responsiveness of MDBs. Inrecent years the MDBs have signiﬁcantly scaled up their work with countries todevelop crisis preparedness plans and to introduce new contingent ﬁnanceinstruments. But more can be done to improve the responsiveness of the ﬁnancialsystem to climate shocks. The UK government is therefore working to promoteClimate Resilient Debt Clauses (CRDCs) with the MDBs, development ﬁnanceinstitutions (DFIs) and the private sector following the announcement of theiradoption by UK Export Finance at COP27.
129. The UK will continue to push for increased volume and effectiveness of MDBclimate change spend, including by encouraging more transparency, scaling upoutcome indicators and targets, strengthening policy-based lending for climate, andensuring the joint MDB climate co-beneﬁts framework incentivises the mostimpactful climate interventions. We will work with MDBs to mainstream climatechange within their technical assistance support, including by supportingborrowers to integrate climate considerations in policy formulation to manageclimate-related ﬁscal risks and strengthen enabling environments.
130. The UK is also pursuing reforms to the International Monetary Fund’sapproaches to ensure it is better able to contribute to climate and nature ﬁnancingchallenges, including:
a. Supporting the Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST), which becameoperational in late-2022. We will continue to shape the RST to ensure it meetsvulnerable countries’ needs for increased ﬁscal space to deal with climateshocks.

b. Advocating to increase ﬁnancing for the poorest countries, and for increasedaccess limits for Low Income Countries and greater resourcing of the PovertyReduction and Growth Trust (PRGT).c. Ensuring that climate and nature degradation risks are better reﬂected inassessments of macroeconomic stability.
3.5.5 Enabling private investment in international climate adaptation.131. The mobilisation of private investment into adaptation projects has facedchallenges, in part due to the difﬁculty in generating sufﬁcient revenue ﬂows fromprojects. In recognition of this and the critical need for adaptation ﬁnance forvulnerable countries, at COP27 the Prime Minister announced that the UK will tripleits funding for adaptation from £500 million in 2019 to £1.5 billion in 2025.
132. To respond to the growing impacts of climate change around the world, privateinvestment needs to be channelled into adaptation. Greater awareness of climaterisk amongst investors will help attract private investment to adaptive projects, andinnovative ﬁnancial approaches have the potential to enable the private sector toplay a greater role. We are drawing lessons from our long-term efforts to increaseprivate investment in mitigation and bringing ﬁnancial institutions together to breakdown investment barriers for adaptation, delivering co-beneﬁts for people, climateand nature.
133. MDBs and DFIs are key actors in scaling up adaptation ﬁnance, and the UK issupporting them, including by investing £200 million in a new AfricanDevelopment Bank Climate Action Window. This seeks to attract privateinvestment for adaptation projects in some of the countries most vulnerabletoclimate change. BII is working with other DFIs through the Adaptation andResilience Investors Collaborative (ARIC), to improve understanding ofinvestment in adaptation solutions and developing tools to support the mobilisationof private investment.
134. The risk proﬁle of investments impacted by climate change remains a criticalbarrier to investment. As such, the UK is supporting the Coalition on ClimateResilient Investment (CCRI) to develop tools to more efﬁciently and effectivelyprice physical climate risk so that the cost of capital is not needlessly inﬂated. CCRIcomprises over 120 members managing $25 trillion in assets.[footnote 188] Its workincludes piloting tools in Jamaica to review critical infrastructure investment gaps,modelling climate risks to that infrastructure, and enabling the government andinvestors to identify investment priorities.
135. As the physical impacts of the climate and nature crises grow, insurance willbecome ever more important to protect the resilience of countries to better respondto disasters. This is why the UK announced in 2021 a new £120 million fundingpackage for Disaster Risk Financing (DFR), helped establish the Global ShieldAgainst Climate Risks, and set up the Centre for Disaster Protection. DFRleverages the expertise and capital of UK insurance and reinsurance markets toincrease the resilience of climate vulnerable countries, by providing cheaper, fasterand more effective responses to disasters. There is strong demand for this support

from climate-vulnerable countries and a track record of success. The Caribbeantransfers over $1.2 billion of hurricane risk each year to its regional risk pool.Africa’s regional insurance scheme has covered over $1 billion of risk so far, and in2021, its scheme paid out over $65 million to help African countries respond todroughts and storms.
Next steps
