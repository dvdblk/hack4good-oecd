National Plan for Industrial Biotechnology - Driving Progress to 2025 
FOREWORD
Scotland’s Economic Strategy prioritises boosting investment and innovation to create a strong, vibrant and sustainable economy. Industrial Biotechnology underpins innovation across a range of sectors to boost prosperity through ‘green’ growth and has the potential to be transformational when considering this aim.
I am proud that Scotland is a world leader in the circular economy. Industrial Biotechnology can help us maintain this by providing a means to manufacture chemicals, pharmaceuticals, consumer products, and many other materials, that uses innovative processes and sustainable raw materials with a reduced carbon footprint – supporting our transition to a low-carbon future. 
In 2013, Scotland launched the National Plan for Industrial Biotechnology which set out ambitious targets of a £900m turnover and over 200 companies active in industrial biotechnology by 2025. Since setting out these targets we have seen great success with the industry growing from 43 to over 100 companies, and a compound annual growth rate of 10% to over £340m per annum.
The Industrial Biotechnology Innovation Centre (IBioIC) was established in 2014 and has quickly been recognised as a European centre of excellence for industry-led research, having supported 48 industry/academia collaborative projects in Scottish universities. IBioIC has developed bespoke training and development programmes to ensure the current and future industry has the necessary skilled workforce to continue to innovate in Scotland: over 50 PhDs and 90 MScs have already been awarded. I am pleased that IBioIC has received funding for a further 5 years to continue supporting this rapidly growing industry. 
I believe that the industrial biotechnology sector in Scotland will continue to make a strong contribution to our economy, and can do so whilst also reducing our impact on the environment. The targets set out in this document may indeed be ambitious. But ambition is the first step to success.

INTRODUCTION
The growth of our bioeconomy is crucial to reduce Scotland’s dependency on carbon intensive feedstocks and to make our manufacturing sector more sustainable which sits firmly within the vision outlined by the Scottish Government’s Climate and Energy Change Plans. 
The themes set out above closely align with the UK Bioeconomy Strategy published in December 2018. It sets out the blueprint in 15 actions for transforming the UK economy through the power of bioscience and biotechnology with the ambition to double the size of the UK bio-economy by 2030 to £440 billion. The actions focus around five key themes of Ideas, People, Infrastructure, Business Environment and Places, and it commits the government to continuing to support the research and innovation landscape, skill the work-force, invest in infrastructure, develop supportive policies and regulatory landscape and create a governance group to oversee the delivery of this strategy.
The National Plan for Industrial Biotechnology (IB) set out to transform the competitiveness and sustainability of multiple sectors in Scotland by: 
•  Industrial Engagement - Increasing awareness 
of biotechnology as a transformation tool 
•  Biorefining - Increasing industry adoption of 
biotechnology to generate increased turnover 
•  Skills – Delivering the skilled workforce needed to meet the needs of this emerging technology
•  Innovation - Facilitating collaborations, 
partnerships and investment to drive innovation
Since launch, great progress has been made across all themes, as summarised opposite. The following pages set out the next steps required to continue this exciting journey for each of these themes. It has been recognised that to deliver success the support of the wider public is necessary, and to get this support the awareness of IB as a technology for good needs to be addressed, therefore an additional theme has been added to the National Plan:
•  Public Awareness - Creating 
a positive environment for the establishment of a Bioeconomy

VISION
Our Vision is to achieve a mature bioeconomy in Scotland by 2025, this will be accomplished by increasing the number of companies active in IB to over 200 and increasing IB related turnover to £900m.
Achieving critical mass will be essential to significantly reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. This will be realised using transformative biobased technologies.
Scotland’s main strengths lie in our research excellence and highly skilled workforce. Innovation will continue to play an integral part to ensure the development of technology from lab scale through to commercial scale facilities. 
To build on the successes that have already been achieved, it’s significantly important that mechanisms are in place and readily available to support companies at every stage of their journey towards manufacturing. The themes outlined in this document will be critical to supporting this journey.

POLICY AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT 
Biotechnology is disruptive innovation that is transforming established and traditional industries into new ways of manufacturing and new supplier chains. The biorefining theme highlights these new chains, some are established and some are new. Recent legislative changes in the harvesting of kelp, which is an identified significant new raw material for extracting high value products, has highlighted the need for public awareness of the benefits that biotechnology can bring to local communities and broader society. Hence, this new theme will work towards improving public awareness of the bioeconomy.
Biotechnology is a positive innovation for Scotland. It is replacing existing pharmaceuticals, chemicals and fuels with similar or better performing materials from sustainable, non-fossil based raw materials. This requires new raw material suppliers, processes and conversion technologies. By developing biotechnology with our existing natural, human, academic and infrastructure resources we reinforce Scotland as a progressive, sustainable, high value manufacturing nation.

INDUSTRY ENGAGEMENT 
A focus on business engagement is crucial to the ongoing growth of Scotland’s bioeconomy. Skirted by a landscape of innovation centres and a connected academic community, unique natural resources including renewable energy, and a pre-existing infrastructure, companies are the engine which drives sectors forward, and should be at the heart of any strategic plan. The close collaboration between industry, academia, and government, known as the triple helix, is unbalanced without an environment which supports, encourages, and engages companies to innovate and expand. 
Approximately 40 companies were originally identified as being active in biotechnology in Scotland, growth to date has come from both organic development of businesses already active in the Scottish bioeconomy, the creation of new entities and a strong value proposition to encourage international direct investment into Scotland.

INNOVATION
Since the launch of the National Plan in 2013, IBioIC have created a large and diverse network of companies and researchers to build collaborative partnerships for development of IB-based technologies, processes and products and  co-funding research and development projects through innovation journeys while developing a skills programme to ensure the growth of the bioeconomy is supported by access to talented people with the correct expertise. Two open access equipment centres have been built: RapidBio (for upstream bioprocess development) and FlexBio (for downstream bioprocessing). The role of the IBioIC moving forward aligns with the mission set out in the Innovation theme.
Scotland has a long history of innovation, particularly in the biotechnology sector, from fermentation technologies used to produce whisky to the development of novel therapeutics. Our industry and universities have world class research expertise in chemistry, biology and engineering, which form the bedrock of biotechnology. If research converts money into knowledge, business innovation capitalises on that knowledge and converts it back into money, returning on the initial investment many times over. The Scottish Government’s goal to fully develop a Circular Economy aligns perfectly with the development of the bioeconomy to ensure maximum value is extracted from precious bioresources using innovative technologies.

SKILLS
The newly developed Skills Investment Plan for Scotland’s Life and Chemical Sciences (launched May 2018) indicates there is an imbalance in volume of graduates versus the supply of technicians: there are sufficient graduates with appropriate degrees, but they lack basic work skills, practical lab experience and the ability to problem solve; skills and training delivery are mainly limited to the central belt of Scotland. The top skills shortages identified by industry are the following:
Developing a skilled workforce for the bioeconomy is essential to meet the demands of IB, which is a disruptive technology. IBioIC has provided critical leadership and resources through its skills and training programmes, from upskilling the existing workforce to educating a new generation at PhD, MSc and HND levels.

uFraction8 took two students from the Industrial Biotechnology MSc programme to develop a new project of digestate separation. This resulted in the decision to proceed into the biomanufacturing market exploiting other market possibilities.
Ingenza, a world leader in the application of IB and Synthetic Biology have invested in skills through the Modern apprenticeship pathway. This has been exemplified by Jack Kay, who joined Ingenza in 2012 as a Life Science apprentice direct for school. Since then, combining Work Based Learning with academic study Jack has achieved a degree in Chemistry with Industrial Experience and been promoted to the role of Scientist in Molecular Biology and recently recognised as the industry’s Rising Star (www.lifesciencesscotland.com). His career path highlights there are many ways young professionals can work their way into the sector.”
Ten-week projects are great opportunity to engage with upcoming biotechnology stars and to give them a shot at real life industrial biotechnology labs, which definitely helps in their future career”

BIOREFINING
Our location and geography give us the potential to generate competitively priced, green, renewable energy to power these biotechnology processes while further reducing its carbon footprint. Innovation in manufacturing and production coupled to innovation in green energy will be advantageous to ensure that Scotland develops its bioeconomy and drives income from exporting technologies worldwide. Developing this symbiotic relationship between our natural resources and innovation in biotechnology are key to our competitive advantage in a global economy.   
The themes of the National Plan are all intrinsically linked, the biorefining theme is critical to deliver the majority of the £900m turnover target by 2025 through combining the outcomes of the other key themes to drive forward the adoption of novel technologies and processes utilising bio-based resources to manufacture innovative and higher value products. 
A phase 2 – ‘Building a Sustainable Future’, of the Biorefinery Roadmap for Scotland strategy and associated milestones will follow on from the publication of this document. The focus of this will be the evolution of the roadmap and the emphasis for the next phase of activity.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
I am delighted with the progress made in the National Plan to date as outlined in this update most importantly demonstrated by the sharp growth in the industry turnover in just a few years. It proves that Scotland is a great place to develop biotechnology. The bioeconomy is good for the environment because it is sustainable and clean. However, it is also disruptive: it requires transformative manufacturing processes and new supply chains to ensure successful delivery. Hence, there is still much to be done to anchor this important technology in Scotland. This updated plan outlines the key steps that are required to deliver the £900 million turnover targeted for 2025. It will require resource, willingness and coordination to make this happen and when it does, it will be a great exemplar of industry, government and academia working together to deliver this highly ambitious plan.
