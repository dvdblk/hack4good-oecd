Foreword
I believe the formula for our success can be seen in the collaboration between industry, science and government that led to the production of the vaccines. Strong and active government investing massively in science and technology, coupled with a dynamic enterprise economy that embraces the instincts and know-how of the private sector. This formula has been central to our success since the industrial revolution, when our great cities built the modern world and the Victorian boom sparked new centres of civic pride, filled with industry and inspiration. 
With hundreds of thousands of needles going into arms every day, our fantastic NHS is shifting the odds in our favour, protecting the people we love and finally offering real hope for the future. These remarkable vaccines are giving us a realistic way forwards to restart our businesses and our lives. As we do so, we must grasp the historic opportunity before us: to learn the lessons of this awful pandemic and build back better, levelling up across our United Kingdom and fixing the problems that have held back too many people for too long. 
htworgro
In that age of invention no one single place could lay claim to being the cradle of innovation – because brilliant minds were advancing the cause of humanity with their genius in every part of our country. A trail of invention and discovery can be traced across our land – from Richard Trevithick’s first steam powered rail journey in Merthyr Tydfil, to the electric carriage pioneered by Robert Anderson in Scotland; from the first man-made plastic by Alexander Parkes of Birmingham, to the first vaccine of Edward Jenner in Gloucestershire, whose institute today worked with AstraZeneca to produce Britain’s Covid vaccine. All proof, if any were ever needed, that brains and talent are uniformly distributed.

Yet in the post-industrial era the distribution of opportunity has failed to match that distribution of talent. While the UK has continued to punch well above its weight as the fifth biggest economy in the world, that punching – and with it jobs and opportunities – have been concentrated in London and theSouth East. Talent and resources have beensucked to the south so that for many peopleand places in Britain and Northern Ireland oureconomic model has just stopped working.People have been denied the opportunitiesto acquire the skills to work in new anddynamic industries, and there has been achasm between invention and commercialapplication as too often “invented in Britain”has translated into “made elsewhere”.
uB
[Page #5]
And we will seize the new opportunities of a Global Britain outside the European Union to make our own regulations, to access global talent, and to forge new trade deals for Britain all around the world.
This plan for growth is a call to arms to put this  right. Our mission is to unleash the potential of our whole country and restore the energy and confidence of the Victorians themselves. Just as the government has done whatever it takes to support lives and livelihoods throughout the Covid crisis, so we will turn that same ambition and resolve to the task of our recovery. We will level up our country, so the map of our whole United Kingdom is lit up with competitive cities and vibrant towns that are centres of life – places people are proud to call home, with access to the services and the jobs they need to thrive. 
htworgro
fnapruo
Above all, we will embrace the instincts and know-how of the wealth creators, those in the private sector who invest money and take risks on new ideas that lead to new jobs, new industry and some of the greatest advances humanity has ever known.

It is human genius and ingenuity that is beating Covid and it is by unlocking that genius and ingenuity across our whole county that we will build back better. In doing so, this plan for growth aspires to serve and support everyone in our United Kingdom, whoever you are and wherever you live.
retteBkcaBd
We will back business large and small, including the millions of entrepreneurs and high street shops who have been hit hard by the pandemic and whose success will be pivotal to getting our economy moving again. Our Plan for Jobs will support new opportunities in every part of the country, while our Lifetime Skills Guarantee will enable anyone to acquire the skills to do those jobs, wherever they live and whatever their stage of life.

We will redress Britain’s historic underinvestment in infrastructure, with £600 billion of gross public sector investment over the next five years, so our United Kingdom becomes a truly connected kingdom. We will make our country a science and technology superpower and the best possible place to create green jobs with our Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution. 
[Page #6]
 While the impact on the economy and people’s lives has been profound, the UK is well-placed to confront the challenges from the COVID-19 crisis. We are an open and dynamic economy, home to some of the best companies in the world. 
In my first Budget nearly a year ago, I said that we would do whatever it took to support the economy in response to the COVID-19 crisis that was just beginning. Throughout, the government’s overriding goal has been to protect the lives and livelihoods of people across the UK. 
We have an international reputation for science and world-class universities. And we have strengths across many sectors, from financial services to creative industries.
The single most important economic policy in the short term is rolling out the vaccine as quickly as possible, where thanks to our extraordinary NHS, we have already vaccinated over 20 million people across the UK.  But as restrictions ease we need to look ahead to the future sources of jobs and growth. Now that we have left the EU we have the opportunity to forge a new path as a fully sovereign trading nation, doing things differently, more nimbly and better.
htworgro
We have put in place an unprecedented economic package to protect, support and create jobs. Through our Plan for Jobs, we have helped millions of people, with the furlough scheme, support for the self-employed, government backed loans, and grants for businesses forced to close. And where people have sadly lost their jobs, we have stepped in to provide further support to help them find work or retrain.

 As we Build Back Better, our plan for growth will focus on three pillars of investment to act as the foundation on which to build the economic recovery, uniting and levelling up the country:
retteBkcaBd
■  High quality infrastructure is crucial foreconomic growth, boosting productivityand competitiveness. The UK hashistorically underinvested in infrastructure,but we are fixing that, starting with £100billion of capital investment in 2021-22.
li
uB
[Page #7]
 ■  We will drive growth that is green: delivering our Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution and taking action to fulfil our commitment to be the first generation to leave the natural environment in a better condition than we found it.
 ■  The best way to improve people’s life chances is to give them the skills to succeed. The UK has a strong foundation of advanced skills, but lags behind international comparators on technical and basic adult skills. The government is transforming Further Education, encouraging lifelong learning through the Lifetime Skills Guarantee, and building an apprenticeships revolution.
 ■   And our plan for growth will support our 
vision for Global Britain, taking advantage of the opportunities available to us now we have left the European Union.
 ■  Innovation drives economic growth and creates jobs. The UK has a world-leading research base, which will be boosted by the government’s significant uplift in R&D investment and the creation of the Advanced Research & Invention Agency to fund high-risk, high-reward research. However, too few businesses are able to access the tools they need to translate new ideas into new products and services and to challenge established businesses. We will make the UK the best ecosystem in the world for starting and growing a business. That means having the best access to capital, skills and ideas, as well as a smart and stable regulatory framework.

 In pursuing economic growth, this government will do things differently:

 ■  Our most important mission is to unite and level up the country: tackling geographic disparities; supporting struggling towns to regenerate; ensuring every region and nation of the UK has at least one globally competitive city; and above all, strengthening the Union.

The last few decades have seen increased prosperity in London and the South East, but without commensurate improvements in the rest of the UK. The primary objective of this government is to change that, ensuring no region is left behind as we achieve greater economic prosperity. Our cities will be the engines for this growth, and our long-term vision is for every region and nation to have at least one internationally competitive city, driving the prosperity of the surrounding region and propelling forward the national economy. Our towns are crucial too - we will ensure that they are places that people are proud to live and raise their families, with  good schools, vibrant high streets, and  access to jobs that give everyone a fair  chance to achieve their full potential.
Over the past year, we have faced substantial challenges, and the last few months have been amongst the most difficult yet. Businesses and schools have had to close, families and friends have been kept apart, and tragically, lives have been lost.
The UK Government has put in place  an unprecedented economic package,  providing businesses and individuals with support and certainty over the course of the pandemic, spending hundreds of billions to support people’s jobs, businesses, and public services across the UK. However, COVID-19 and the restrictions put in place to stop the spread of the virus caused the largest fall in annual GDP in 300 years.
But we are well placed to confront these challenges, rebounding to build back better: the UK’s departure from the European Union presents further opportunities for us to do things differently, opening up new ways to drive growth. The UK is one of the world’s largest economies, open and dynamic, with strong institutions and world-class universities. 
Our plan to build back better takes a transformational approach, tackling long-term problems to deliver growth that creates high-quality jobs across the UK and makes the most of the strengths of the Union. We must retain our guiding focus on achieving the people’s priorities: levelling up the whole of the UK, supporting our transition to net zero, and supporting our vision for Global Britain.

The UK is a great place to start and grow a business, home to some of the world’s best companies. We have an international reputation for science: the development and manufacture of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine demonstrated the strong partnerships that exist between universities and businesses in the UK. This strength extends to sectors such as aerospace, the creative industries, financial services, and emerging industries such as AI and fintech.

We will do this by building on three core pillars of growth:
We will...
 ■  Stimulate short-term economic activity and drive long-term 
Infrastructure
productivity improvements via record investment in broadband, roads, rail and cities, as part of our capital spending plans worth £100 billion next year. 
 ■  Connect people to opportunity via the UK-wide Levelling Up 
Fund and UK Shared Prosperity Fund, as well as the Towns Fund and High Street Fund, to invest in local areas. 
 ■  Help achieve net zero via £12 billion of funding for projects through 
the Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution.
 ■  Support investment through the new UK Infrastructure Bank which will ‘crowd-in’ private investment to accelerate our progress to net zero, helping to level up the UK. This will invest in local authority and private sector infrastructure projects, as well as providing an advisory function to help with the development and delivery of projects.

 ■  Support productivity growth through high-quality skills and training: transforming Further Education through additional investment and reforming technical education to align the post-16 technical education system with employer demand. 
Skills

 ■  Introduce the Lifetime Skills Guarantee to enable lifelong learning through free fully funded Level 3 courses, rolling out employer-led skills bootcamps, and introducing the Lifelong Loan Entitlement. 
retteBkcaBd
 ■  Continue to focus on the quality of apprenticeships and take steps to improve the apprenticeship system for employers, through enabling the transfer of unspent levy funds and allowing employers to front load apprenticeship training.
li
uB
 ■  Support and incentivise the development of the creative ideas and technologies that will shape the UK’s future high-growth, sustainable and secure economy.
Innovation
 ■  Support access to finance to help unleash innovation, including through reforms to address disincentives for pension funds to invest in high-growth companies, continued government support for start ups and scale ups through programmes such as British Patient Capital, and a new £375 million Future Fund: Breakthrough product to address the scale up gap for our most innovative businesses.
 ■  Develop the regulatory system in a way that supports innovation.
 ■  Attract the brightest and best people, boosting growth and 
driving the international competitiveness of the UK’s high-growth, innovative businesses.
 ■  Support our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to 
grow through two new schemes to boost productivity: Help to Grow: Management, a new management training offer, and Help to Grow: Digital, a new scheme to help 100,000 SMEs save time and money by adopting productivity-enhancing software, transforming the way they do business.
[Page #12]
Not all growth is created equal. The growth we drive will:
 ■  Regenerate struggling towns in all parts of the UK via 
Level up the whole of the UK
the UK Shared Prosperity Fund and the UK-wide Levelling Up Fund. 
 ■  Realise our long-term vision for every region and nation to 
have at least one globally competitive city at its heart to help drive prosperity. This includes City and Growth Deals, £4.2 billion in intra-city transport settlements from 2022-23, and continued Transforming Cities Fund investment to 2022-23. 
 ■  Catalyse centres of excellence, supporting individuals across the country to access jobs and opportunities by ensuring digital and transport connectivity, by establishing a new UK Infrastructure Bank in the North of England and by relocating 22,000 Civil Service roles out of London. 
 ■  Strengthen the Union, creating Freeports across the 
country – including in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – and delivering the Union Connectivity Review, reviewing options to improve our sea, air and land-links across the four nations.

 ■  Cooperate with partners to inspire and shape international action on our domestic priorities, including through our G7 Presidency and COP26. 
Support our vision for Global Britain
 ■  Role-model openness to free and fair trade, working 
internationally to strengthen the multilateral system and the World Trade Organization and using preferential agreements and bilateral trade relationships to directly expand trading opportunities for UK businesses.  
 ■  Develop a new export strategy to align our support for 
exporters with our plan for growth and sectoral priorities, opening UK Government trade hubs in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and increasing UK Export Finance lending capacity.
[Page #13]
We will carry this out with a relentless focus on delivery, using clear metrics to monitor progress and ensure success. Over the next twelve months, we will build on the strong foundation set out in this plan to make real progress.
By combining new approaches with our well-established strengths, we will deliver growth that benefits the whole of the United Kingdom, creates quality jobs, and ensures that we build back better.

As the economy starts to recover, we must confront the challenges created by COVID-19 and minimise the risk of lasting economic damage from this crisis across all corners of the UK. Jobs are the key economic priority. There will be a period of adjustment, as some jobs are lost, and people find new work in growing businesses or spot new opportunities to start their own. That is why through the Plan for Jobs the UK Government is focusing on delivering employment support, including work search or support with retraining, to those who need it most, from helping the recently unemployed to swiftly find new work, to offering greater support for people who will find that journey more difficult. 
The challenges faced by the UK over the past twelve months have been substantial, and the last few months have been amongst the most difficult yet. Businesses and schools have had to close, families and friends have been kept apart, and tragically, lives have been lost.
li

COVID-19 and the restrictions put in place to stop the spread of the virus caused the largest fall in annual GDP in 300 years. The UK Government has put in place significant support measures to limit the rise in unemployment and insolvencies. This includes the furlough scheme, support for the self-employed, government backed loans, and grants for businesses forced to close. This support package, worth hundreds of billions, has helped all regions and nations of the UK.
[Page #17]
Plan for Jobs
The UK has one of the most successful labour markets, which pre-COVID-19 delivered record employment rates. The government has taken unprecedented action to protect jobs during  the pandemic, most notably through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS). However,  the government is also supporting people who have unfortunately lost their jobs, helping them  search for work or retrain, by:
 ■  Significantly expanding Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) Jobcentre support,  
including doubling the number of work coaches, additional investment into the Flexible  Support Fund to provide direct support at a local level, and additional intensive support  to those who have been unemployed for at least three months.
 ■  Introducing the £2 billion Kickstart scheme, which will provide young people at risk of  long-term unemployment with fully-subsidised jobs to give them experience and skills. 
 ■  Introducing the £2.9 billion Restart programme, which will provide regular, personalised  support for those on Universal Credit who have been searching for work for over a year.
 ■  Supporting people to build the skills they need to get into work, with a substantial  
expansion of existing provision, providing funding to expand the number of traineeships  and sector-based work academy placements, alongside further support for new apprentice  hiring, which enables people to work while training.
htworgro
These policies are important for the short-term recovery, helping to keep people close to the labour market and develop work experience and skills. They will help to ensure that the wider government labour market and skills offer also helps achieve long-term prosperity.

The scale of the challenge ahead is large. In December 2020 GDP was 6.3% below its February 2020 level; and business investment in the final quarter of last year was 19.2% lower than the year before. At its lowest point in November 2020, the number of employees had fallen by 882,000 (-3%) since February. 
That adaptability and resilience will prove vital in the months and years ahead, as the UK economy continues to transform. Technological innovations will change every sector of the economy, supporting higher earnings and shorter working days. New trading relationships will offer opportunities for our businesses to experience the benefits of exporting. The UK Government, alongside businesses and individuals, will harness the benefits of the transition to net zero, including an enhanced natural environment, cleaner air in our cities and new green jobs. Private sector investment will be a vital complement to planned public sector investment, and so it is crucial that we create the right conditions to unlock that investment and create jobs and growth. 
li
uB
The COVID-19 shock has highlighted the great adaptability and resilience of UK businesses. Employers moved at speed to migrate services online, enabled their employees to work from home where possible, and adapted their premises to be COVID-secure. Over 60% of businesses have adopted new digital technologies during the pandemic1.

The 2017 Industrial Strategy set out a cross-economy approach to boost productivity. But much has changed since 2017, so it is right that we create a new framework for how we will build back better. This document details our focus on infrastructure, skills and innovation. It reflects new opportunities available to us following our exit from the European Union, opening up new ways to drive growth and supporting our vision for Global Britain. This plan also demonstrates that we will not pursue growth at the expense of the government's wider objectives - instead we see real opportunities to boost our economic performance while levelling up across the UK and in a way that contributes to reaching net zero emissions.
 ■  World class knowledge and research – The UK has a high share of the adult population with tertiary education, over seven percentage points higher than the OECD average4. Four of the world’s top 20 universities are in the UK5. The UK punches above its weight on article downloads, citations and world’s most highly-cited articles. The UK is ranked 4th on the 2020 Global Innovation Index6. 
 ■   A stable framework for growth and strong institutions – The UK’s macroeconomic framework and institutions, for example through the commitment to low, stable inflation and financial stability through an independent central bank, enable the right conditions for the economy to succeed. Macroeconomic stability gives consumers, businesses and financial markets confidence to participate and invest in the real economy. The UK is committed to independent economic regulation and its institutions, such as its legal system, are respected around the world.

Creating an environment       that enables  the UK to succeed
Economic growth is driven by increasing employment and productivity. The UK must return to growing employment and take action to address weak productivity in order to secure a sustainable increase in growth.
At the start of last year, the UK’s employment rate was at a record high (76.6% in the three months to February 2020), and 3.5 percentage points higher than its pre-financial crisis peak. This employment growth was led by the private sector. The plan for growth will help to build a business environment that gets UK hiring and investing again. 
UK businesses have a good record in creating jobs, with the UK outperforming most other comparable OECD countries on employment.

In the long run, productivity gains are the fundamental source of improvements in prosperity. Productivity is closely linked to incomes and living standards and supports employment. Improvements in productivity free up money to invest in jobs and support our ability to spend on public services.

Long-term investment in the country’s human and physical capital increases productivity. This means investing in people’s skills, the knowledge and capital within businesses, and the economic infrastructure that is the backbone of the economy, such as roads and broadband. We also need the right conditions to enable a dynamic economy that can encourage innovation and allow resources to be used most productively, which in practice means people being able to find high-quality work.
A long-term vision must be backed by action, and the plan for growth makes this possible by focusing on three pillars that are critical to supporting long-run growth and where UK action in the past has fallen short: infrastructure, skills and innovation.
The UK has had a long-standing productivity gap to other major economies - in 2019, the gap in output per hour worked between the UK and France was one percentage point different to the gap 40 years before9.

 Much of the reason for this gap lies in historic low levels of investment in physical capital - from underinvestment in infrastructure and weaker business investment compared to our peers - and lower levels of basic and technical skills. In the last 20 years, average investment as a percentage of GDP has been the lowest in the G710, and 18% of adults have a vocational qualification, compared to the OECD average of 27%11.
Our commitment to Levelling Up means tackling these disparities, which are some of the widest of any advanced economy and have been getting wider over time. In 1998, London accounted for 20% of UK GVA, but by 2018 this had risen to 24%. Important explanations for these differences are the distribution of skills between regions, and cities outside London not fully capturing the benefits of their size.

This is why a radical uplift in infrastructure investment and creating new skills training opportunities across the UK form two of the pillars of our plan for growth. Improving the UK’s performance in these areas would help to close the productivity gap between the UK and other countries, and close productivity gaps within the UK. 
This is why the third pillar of the plan for growth is fostering the conditions to unleash innovation. This means maintaining a business environment where productive firms are able to scale up, barriers to business investment are removed and the constraints to new ideas and technology spreading through the economy are low.
li
uB
Productivity growth has also slowed since the financial crisis. While the UK ranks highly as one of the most dynamic economies amongst its competitors, there are signs dynamism has been reducing and played a part in the slowdown. 
[Page #24]
Building on the        pillars of growth
The quality of our infrastructure is lower than many other countries. The UK Government has already announced a record amount of capital and infrastructure investment at the Spending Review 2020 and in the National Infrastructure Strategy12. The plan for growth sets out how this investment will help the economy to recover, tackle our long-standing productivity gap, and lay the foundations for our long-term sustainable growth.
Innovation, including cutting-edge research and how businesses adapt their products and processes, will be an important part of improving UK productivity growth. The UK has a world-leading research base, and while we have some of the best companies in the world, we also have a lower proportion of innovative firms overall than other advanced economies13.  The plan for growth outlines measures that support and unlock innovative activity. These measures will support the high-growth businesses that make a significant contribution to employment and allow technology and best practice to diffuse through the economy to the benefit of all. 
htworgro
Skills play a crucial role in shaping people’s life chances. The UK has a strong foundation of advanced skills and a number of world-class universities, but lags behind international comparators on technical and basic adult skills. Improving skills opportunities will be important to productivity growth. The plan for growth sets out the range of interventions the UK Government is taking to drive improvements in skills. 
fnapruo
Delivering improved infrastructure, skills and innovation will be a joint endeavour between local authorities, combined authorities, the devolved administrations and the UK Government.

 ■  Net Zero: the UK will continue to be at the forefront of tackling climate change and is already a world leader in clean growth. We will deliver the Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution, leveraging significant private sector investment and supporting up to 250,000 highly-skilled jobs; we will take action to fulfil our commitment to be the first generation to leave the natural environment in a better condition than we found it; and we will ensure the finance sector can play its role to support the transition to net zero. 
Growth that delivers the people’s priorities
The plan for growth is targeted at building on the UK’s strengths and addressing weaknesses in order to boost economic growth and employment. However, we recognise that not all types of growth are equal. The focus of this government is to ensure the benefits of growth are spread to all corners of the UK, driving growth that delivers the people’s priorities:
 ■  Levelling Up: the UK government’s most important mission is to unite and level up the country, improving everyday life for communities throughout the UK and ensuring everyone can succeed regardless of where they live. We will tackle geographic disparities in key services and outcomes, like health, education, and jobs; we will support struggling towns so they see social, economic and cultural regeneration; we want every region and nation of the UK to have at least one globally competitive city, acting as hotbeds of innovation and hubs of high value activity; and we will ensure that this plan builds on the strengths of the Union.
 ■  Global Britain: the UK’s prosperity is built on our integration into the global economic and financial system. Following our exit from the European Union, we can also take advantage of the opportunities that come with our new status as a fully sovereign trading nation. We will role model free and fair trade, ensure the UK remains a leading destination for global investment, and support opportunities for trade and collaboration.

High quality infrastructure is crucial for economic growth, boosting productivity and competitiveness. More than this, it is at the centre of our communities. Infrastructure helps connect people to each other, people to businesses, and businesses to markets, forming a foundation for economic activity and community prosperity. Well-developed transport networks allow businesses to grow and expand, enabling them to extend supply chains, deepen labour and product markets, collaborate, innovate and attract inward investment. Digital connectivity is unlocking new and previously unimaginable ways of working, and is now essential to facilitate public services, including healthcare and education.

 ■  Putting the UK on the path to meeting its net zero emissions target by 2050 by taking steps to decarbonise the UK’s power, heat and transport networks – which together account for over two-thirds of UK emissions – and take steps to adapt to the risks posed by climate change.  
The government is committed to  transforming the UK’s infrastructure and increased investment is also a central part of economic recovery. The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced enormous short-term disruption and may have long-term effects on the way people live, for instance with less daily commuting. However, this does not undermine the long-term arguments for infrastructure. Instead, it requires the government to be flexible and adapt to the country’s changing needs. Investment in digital, transport and utilities networks is still required to underpin economic recovery and growth. 
 ■  Supporting private investment by 
providing investors with clarity over the UK Government’s plans, so they can look to the UK with confidence and help deliver the upgrades and projects needed across the country. 
 ■  Accelerating and improving delivery through wide-ranging Project Speed reforms including streamlining the planning system; improving the way projects are procured and delivered; and greater use  of cutting-edge construction technology.
A 10% increase in the public capital stock – a measurement of the value of the UK’s current infrastructure networks – has been linked to a 1-2% increase  in GDP, partly through productivity improvements14.

Infrastructure can also support other UK Government policy objectives. For instance, it can improve skills and education through investment in digital technology and buildings, and health outcomes through investment in our health infrastructure. It is a key factor in determining where firms choose to locate and grow, and people’s ability to access resources. It unlocks development of housing. It can also support and enable our businesses to integrate into the international economy and trade goods and services across the world.

Delivering historic
levels of infrastructure
investment
The UK has historically underinvested in infrastructure, with a smaller capital stock than comparable countries and ranking 11th globally for infrastructure quality, behind both France and Germany16. We are fixing that – Spending Review 2020 committed £100 billion of capital investment in 2021-22, a £30 billion cash increase compared to 2019-20. These plans make progress on delivering the UK Government’s objective of over £600 billion of gross public sector investment over the next five years.  
The private sector also plays a vital role in achieving the UK’s infrastructure ambitions. Much of UK’s economic infrastructure is privately owned, with almost half of the UK’s future infrastructure pipeline forecast to be privately financed. Over the past decade alone, over £200 billion has been invested in the water and energy sectors. However, historic levels of investment will be required in UK infrastructure in the coming years, to maintain and upgrade networks to meet the UK Government’s objectives for economic growth and decarbonisation.

Building back better,
greener and faster
As a part of Project Speed, we will rigorously review the cost and delivery times of infrastructure projects. We will transform the way infrastructure is done in this country: it will be more efficiently delivered, driven by new technologies and less bureaucracy. It will be built better, with the construction of world-class schools and hospitals. Infrastructure will also be greener to align with our net zero ambitions.  
The UK Government needs to deliver infrastructure projects better, greener and faster. That means addressing longstanding challenges such as complex planning processes, slow decision-making, government capability and low productivity in the construction sector.  
As set out in the Prime Minister’s Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution, infrastructure investment is fundamental to delivering net zero emissions by 2050. The UK Government will unlock private sector investment to accelerate the deployment of existing technology, such as retrofitting the UK’s building stock and electrification of vehicles, while advancing newer technologies such as carbon capture and low carbon hydrogen. The UK Government’s approach will create jobs to support the recovery from COVID-19 and support the UK Government’s levelling-up agenda by ensuring key industrial areas are at the heart of the transition to net zero. As Glasgow hosts the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 next year, the UK will go even further to promote the importance of low carbon infrastructure and support its commitment to the Paris Agreement.
These reforms will have a material impact on project timelines, bringing forward real benefits to local communities, business and the wider economy across the UK. The A66 Northern Trans-Pennine upgrade connecting the North East and North West of England will be accelerated through Project Speed and is expected to be delivered five years sooner through radical acceleration of the construction schedule. The Budget confirms £135 million development phase funding to get spades in the ground by 2024.

Our exit from the EU also provides a transformational opportunity to change how this government delivers infrastructure projects, using the flexibility the UK has as a sovereign country to do things differently. The government wants the UK to have the most efficient, technologically advanced and sustainable construction sector in the world. In June last year, the government set up Project Speed to review every part of the infrastructure project lifecycle and identify where improvements could be made, such as on procurement.

Project Speed Pathfinders
The Project Speed taskforce has focused on a number of high-profile “pathfinder projects” to identify reforms which could accelerate and improve delivery across the UK Government’s infrastructure portfolio. This is an evolving subset of projects, which is kept under review, but examples of current pathfinder projects include:
 ■  The Oxford-Cambridge Arc, led by the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local 
Government (MHCLG) 
 ■  The New Hospital Programme within the Health Infrastructure Plan, led by the Department 
of Health & Social Care (DHSC)

Maintaining and building on the UK’s high-quality system of economic regulation will be crucial to attracting private investment. In the National Infrastructure Strategy, the government reaffirmed its belief in the model of independent economic regulation and committed to refining it, to ensure that it provides a clear and enduring framework  for investors and businesses and delivers the major investment needed in decades to come, whilst continuing to deliver fair outcomes for consumers. The UK Government will publish a policy paper on the system of economic regulation, focused on providing a clear and predictable framework which can rise to the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century. As part of this, the UK Government will consider regulator duties to ensure they are coherent, relevant and effective, as well as exploring the benefits of a cross-sector strategic policy statement. 
The Union Connectivity Review will assess how the quality and availability of transport infrastructure across the UK can support economic growth and quality of life across the whole of the UK. The review will deliver recommendations in Summer 2021 that set  out how best to improve transport connectivity across the UK in the long-term, including bolstering existing connections. These recommendations will be consistent with the UK’s wider fiscal strategy. This will help us to consider future strategic investment to better connect our Union.
The UK Government is soon to publish a White Paper setting out the future of the railways.  This will respond to the recommendations of  The Williams Rail Review into rail industry reform.
While the UK Government will be investing record amounts in infrastructure, the private sector will continue to play a leading role. To facilitate this, the government is establishing a new UK Infrastructure Bank in the North of England to bring together public and private support for new infrastructure. The new UK Infrastructure Bank will provide financing and advisory support to local authority and private sector infrastructure projects across the United Kingdom to help meet government objectives on climate change and regional economic growth. It will be able to deploy £12 billion of equity and debt capital and be able to issue up to £10 billion of guarantees. Further details on the mandate and scope for the bank are set out in the UK Infrastructure Bank Policy Design document, published alongside Budget 2021.

The UK Government’s commitment to ensuring infrastructure investment delivers regional economic growth means we will be investing in: 
 ■  The Oxford-Cambridge Arc, where a Spatial Framework, developed with community engagement at its core, will set the long-term, holistic strategy for infrastructure investment to support jobs, unlock clean growth, and achieve net zero alongside environmental sustainability; cultivating the Arc’s potential to become a global innovation powerhouse. Earlier this year the government confirmed funding  for the next stage of East West Rail, which will connect communities and create jobs. We are also exploring up to four development corporations along its route which can help deliver sustainable, beautiful places to live and work for existing and future communities.
 ■  City and Growth Deals for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. To accelerate local economic priorities, £25.8 million will be brought forward over the next five years for three City and Growth Deals in Scotland (Ayrshire, Argyll & Bute, and Falkirk) and £58.7 million will be brought forward over the next five years for three City and Growth Deals in Wales (Swansea, north Wales and mid-Wales). The UK Government is also investing £617 million in four City and Growth Deals in Northern Ireland.

The contribution of skills to productivity growth, however, can largely be attributed to higher-skilled cohorts22, and the UK’s skills system is less competitive internationally in areas such as technical skills and basic adult skills23. 
Combined, these factors mean that there are significant levels of mismatch between what the skills system provides and what employers need: the OECD found that the UK could improve its productivity by 5% or more if it reduced the level of skills mismatch to that of high performing international comparators27.  Reforms to the technical skills system to support providers to respond to employer needs will play an important role in addressing these mismatches and driving growth at a national and regional level. 
A particular challenge is the pipeline of technical skills: the UK has persistent technical skills shortages in key sectors such as construction and manufacturing. Only 4% of young people achieve a higher technical qualification by the age of 25, compared to 33% who get a degree or above24  Since the 2000s, higher technical education as a whole has fallen in absolute terms25.  
Overall, while there are notable strengths in the UK skills system, such as universities and apprenticeships, further reform is needed to address these challenges. The UK Government has put in place a package of immediate employment and skills support delivered through the Plan for Jobs, and is taking broader action to ensure people have the support they need to improve their skills over the longer term, as a key enabler of productivity growth. 
On basic skills, more than a quarter of the working-age population in England have low literacy or numeracy skills. The Industrial Strategy Council forecast that five million workers could become acutely under-skilled in basic digital skills by 203026. This holds back those people from employment, limits their ability to progress, reduces economic growth, and makes the UK a less attractive place to invest.

Transforming     Further Education
Recognising the importance of technical education, the UK Government has invested significant additional funding in Further Education (FE) in England, with an additional £691 million for core 16-19 education at the last two Spending Reviews, and a further £375 million to fund technical education for adults as the first step in a £2.5 billion investment in adult skills over the course of this Parliament through the National Skills Fund. The UK Government has also made significant capital commitments in post-16 education, with £1.5 billion over six years to raise the condition of the FE college estate, £270 million to establish 20 Institutes of Technology, £268 million across three waves to support the roll-out of T Levels with high quality equipment and facilities, and £83 million in 21/22 to ensure post-16 providers have sufficient places.  
The UK Government is reforming technical education, making it a true alternative to a degree by delivering the training and education that employers want. 
This includes aligning the substantial majority of post-16 technical education and training to employer-led standards, introducing new approved Higher Technical Qualifications as a high quality technical progression option, rolling out T Levels (see box below) and expanding the flagship Institutes of Technology programme to every part of the country by the end of this Parliament – to spearhead the increase in higher-level technical skills in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths.

uB
T Levels will be the option of choice in England for the majority of 16 to 19 year-olds who want to progress into high-skilled employment or onto higher levels of technical education at college or university. Students spend most of the course in classrooms and specialist training facilities, developing the knowledge, skills and behaviours that employers need for their chosen occupation. They also spend at least 45 days on a meaningful industry placement, putting the skills they have developed into practice and gaining first-hand experience of industry. Around 300 employers have been involved in designing content, and thousands more will be offering industry placements. Students across England started on the first ever T Levels in September 2020; from 2023, we expect that 24 T Levels covering 11 technical education routes will be available.

To ensure that skills provision is aligned to employer needs, the UK Government has published Skills for Jobs: Lifelong Learning for Opportunity and Growth which sets out how we will reform further education in England so it supports people to develop the skills throughout their lives, wherever they live in the country28. This reform will be delivered by putting employers at the heart of our skills system, supporting excellent teaching in further education, and reforming funding and accountability to ensure a focus on the needs of local labour markets, enabling flexible  employer-led provision, and reducing unnecessary bureaucracy. 
Encouraging lifelong learning 
Recognising the vital role of training and retraining over the course of an adult’s lifetime, and as the Prime Minister set out in his speech in September 2020, the UK Government will help people get the skills they need at every stage in their lives through the Lifetime Skills Guarantee. 
These reforms are backed by significant investment in adult skills. The UK Government has committed to a new £2.5 billion National Skills Fund over the course of this Parliament to improve the technical skills of adults in England. The UK Government will also introduce the UK Shared Prosperity Fund (UKSPF) to help to level up and create opportunity across the UK for people and places. A portion of the UKSPF will be targeted at bespoke employment and skills support tailored to local need.

Starting from April 2021, adults looking to achieve their first full advanced level (level 3) qualification, which is equivalent to an advanced technical certificate or diploma, or two full A levels, will be able to access a free, fully funded course as part of the Lifetime Skills Guarantee. These courses, in areas including business, engineering, health and social care, and digital, will improve people’s employment prospects and open up new opportunities. 
Our employer-led skills bootcamps will also be rolled out across England from April as part of the Lifetime Skills Guarantee building on the successful digital bootcamps pilots. Skills bootcamps are 12 to 16-week training courses linked to guaranteed job interviews that support adults to retrain, top up skills, or gain new specialist skills in areas that are in-demand by employers in a bitesize and flexible way.

We will reform student finance to provide individuals with a flexible Lifelong Loan Entitlement from 2025, the equivalent of four years of post-18 education. The loan entitlement will be useable for both shorter modules and full years of study at higher technical and degree levels (levels 4-6), regardless of whether they are provided in colleges or universities, making it easier for people to study more flexibly throughout their lifetime.

 ■  From April 2021, the UK Government will allow English employers in construction, health and social care to front-load apprenticeship training, and will explore whether this offer can also be made available in other sectors.
Building on the  apprenticeships revolution 
The UK Government has transformed apprenticeships in England to ensure that they better meet the skills needs of employers across the country and provide people of all ages and backgrounds with the opportunity to benefit from a high-quality apprenticeship.  
Building on the measures the Government announced at Spending Review 2020 to improve the apprenticeship system for employers, the Budget outlines a £7 million fund from July 2021 to help employers in England set up and expand portable apprenticeships. This will enable people who need to work across multiple projects with different employers to benefit from the high-quality long-term training that doing an apprenticeship provides. Employers themselves will also benefit from access to a diverse apprenticeship talent pipeline. 
The Apprenticeship Levy is an important part of these changes as it encourages employers to make a long-term, sustainable and high-quality investment in apprenticeship training. As part of these changes, standards have helped make apprenticeships employer-led, and we have seen over 440,000 apprentices start on the new standards between the 2014/15 and 2018/19 academic years29. 
htworgro
Building on these reforms, we will continue to focus on the quality of apprenticeships and take steps to improve the English apprenticeship system for employers. Spending Review 2020 announced the following: 
The UK Government will also extend and increase the payments made to employers who hire new apprentices. Employers in England who hire a new apprentice between 1 April 2021 and 30 September 2021 will receive £3,000 per new hire, compared with £1,500 per new apprentice hire (or £2,000 for those aged 24 and under) under the previous scheme. This is in addition to the existing £1,000 payment the government provides for all new 16 to 18 year-old apprentices and those aged under 25 with an Education, Health and Care Plan, where  that applies.

 ■  From August 2021, employers who pay the Apprenticeships Levy will be able to transfer unspent levy funds in bulk to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with a new pledge function. We will build on good examples of this activity already in existence – for instance the West Midlands Levy Transfer Fund – by also introducing, from August 2021, a new online service to match levy payers with SMEs that share their business priorities.

West Midlands Levy Transfer Fund: 
Employers who pay the Apprenticeship Levy can transfer up to 25% of their unspent levy funds to small to medium-sized businesses who share their business priorities. The West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA) set up a scheme in 2018 to facilitate these transfers and supercharge apprenticeships in the West Midlands. Employers like Lloyds Banking Group, BBC, National Express and the University of Birmingham have partnered with the WMCA to transfer their unspent levy to smaller employers who want to offer apprenticeships in key skills areas. The fund recently hit a £5 million milestone and has supported over 1,000 new apprenticeships at small to medium-sized businesses across the region.

Innovation is a key driver of economic growth and improvements to living standards, through the development of new ideas, products and processes and their adoption and diffusion across the economy. This brings benefits for both citizens and society. 
[Page #50]
The UK has a lower proportion of innovating firms overall than other advanced economies and weaker business investment35,36. The diffusion of innovation through the economy requires businesses to update their business models and make investments that embody newer ideas. Our commitments to regulatory reform and a best in class competition regime will raise innovation and investment across the whole economy. Aligning skills provision to employer needs will also ensure that people are equipped to experience the benefits of innovation and help give firms the confidence to invest.
The UK is renowned for its science and innovation strengths, ranking 4th out of 131 economies in the Global Innovation Index30. We are home to world-leading research institutes and charities, with the UK ranking first in the G7 for field-weighted citation impact in the G731, as well as excellent universities – including four in the world’s top 2032 – which work closely with businesses and international partners. This research ecosystem stimulates innovation through the exchange of ideas, knowledge and talent.  
The UK also has the most mature venture capital market in Europe: at least £8.8 billion in 2020 was raised to start and grow innovative businesses, more than France and Germany combined33. However, UK companies can still struggle to access capital compared to their US counterparts, especially at later stages of their growth and larger deal sizes. There remains a largely untapped pool of capital from institutional investors, particularly Defined Contribution (DC) pension schemes. Investment also tends to be regionally concentrated in London and the South East, whilst women and entrepreneurs from BAME backgrounds disproportionately struggle to access the finance they need to start and grow their business.
Relatedly, there is evidence that UK firms are relatively slow to adopt basic digital technologies, such as customer relationship and eCommerce tools that have been shown to have significant productivity benefits37. When it comes to digital intensity, we are ahead of some of our major European competitors, but lag behind international leaders like Denmark, Israel and Japan38. The UK Government is taking steps to help UK businesses significantly improve their adoption of digital technologies.

To maximise the economic benefits of the UK Government’s significant investments in research and development (R&D) and build a more innovative and productive economy, the UK needs a regulatory system that is pro-innovation. Currently only 29% of businesses believe that the government’s approach to regulation supports them in bringing new products and services to market34. We are committed to regulatory reform to accommodate new processes, products and business models, and provide a supportive environment to dynamic entrepreneurial business.

Next year alone we are investing £14.6 billion in research and innovation grants and facilities. This investment will back the priorities set out in the UK Government’s Research and Development Roadmap39 and drive progress towards the target for total UK investment in R&D (public and private) to reach 2.4% of GDP by 2027.

Public investment in R&D crowds in private investment40 at a ratio of around two pounds on average for each pound of government funding. Schemes such as the Biomedical Catalyst - a joint Medical Research Council and Innovate UK grant programme that accelerates innovations in the life sciences - have proven to be highly effective in driving business investment in R&D. The government will build on this, supporting new opportunities to strengthen the innovation ecosystem including through the public procurement reforms planned later this year, investing £800 million in the new Advanced Research and Invention Agency, and publishing an Innovation Strategy in Summer 2021.

UK R&D expenditure is currently concentrated in a relatively small number of large firms based in particular regions of the country41. The UK Government is committed to redressing this balance, by leveraging the capability of the UK’s geographically dispersed R&D assets, maximising the benefits of innovation for local economies and building on local strengths. Details of this will be set out in a UK-wide R&D Places Strategy this year, focusing on how R&D can contribute effectively to the government’s levelling up ambitions.
R&D tax reliefs support businesses to invest in R&D by allowing companies to claim an enhanced corporation tax deduction or payable credit on their R&D costs. In 2017-18, R&D tax reliefs of £5.1 billion supported £36.5 billion of R&D expenditure42. The government has now announced it will carry out a review of R&D tax reliefs, with a consultation published alongside the Budget. The government is also publishing at Budget 2021 the summary of responses from the consultation on the scope of qualifying expenditures for R&D Tax Credits. The decision on whether to bring data and cloud computing costs into scope of the reliefs will be made alongside the wider review43.

Over many decades the UK has established clusters of the most advanced scientific research facilities anywhere in the world, made possible by top class universities – including in Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Cardiff and Belfast - globally-renowned clinical research and a unique cradle to grave healthcare system in the NHS. The government has worked closely with industry and scientists to grow the life sciences sector through delivering the 2017 Life Sciences Industrial Strategy. This provided a roadmap for the UK to take the lead on cutting-edge, emerging industries such as genomics, early-stage diagnostics, advanced therapies and digital health.

Government and financial regulators have removed a range of regulatory barriers to ensure that pension savers can access the returns offered by venture capital and growth equity, as part of a balanced portfolio. Government will consult in the next month on whether certain costs affect DC pension schemes’ ability to invest in a broader range of assets. This is to ensure DC pension schemes are not discouraged from such investments and are able to offer the highest possible returns for savers. The Department for Work and Pensions will also come forward with draft regulations that will make it easier for schemes to take up such opportunities.
At this Budget, we will build on our progress to fill financing gaps for companies at all stages.

Attracting global talent and

High-skilled migration can boost growth and drive the international competitiveness of the UK’s high-growth innovative businesses. These businesses disproportionately contribute to innovation and job creation in the UK and disproportionately employ or are founded by migrants. Around 42% of UK fintech workers are from overseas45 and, whilst only 14% of UK residents are foreign-born, 49% of the UK’s fastest growing businesses and nine of the UK’s 14 unicorns (start-ups with a valuation of $1 billion) have at least one foreign-born co-founder46. To ensure the continued competitiveness of our high-growth, innovative sectors the UK needs to outpace global competition with a visa offering that can attract and retain the best and brightest from around the world.

Encouraging the       adoption and diffusion of innovative ideas and    technologies across the economy
Even the most innovative economies are characterised by only a minority of firms engaging in innovation at the cutting edge.  The full benefits of innovation are realised when new ideas and technologies are adopted and diffused by firms throughout the economy. 
At Budget 2021 we are announcing a new UK-wide management programme to upskill 30,000 SMEs in the UK over three years. Developed in partnership with industry, the programme will combine a national curriculum delivered through business schools with practical case studies and mentoring from experienced business professionals, equipping SMEs with the tools to grow their businesses and thrive. Improved SME management is strongly correlated with tech adoption.

Adoption of a range of common technologies is associated with a productivity improvement of between 7% to 18%, depending on the technology49. ICT adopted with good management practices achieves a 20% productivity improvement compared to just a 2% uplift when adopted with poor practices50.

We are also announcing Help to Grow: Digital, a new scheme to help 100,000 SMEs save time and money by adopting productivity-enhancing software, transforming the way they do business. Launching later this year, Help to Grow: Digital will combine a voucher covering up to half of the costs of preapproved solutions up to a maximum of £5,000, and free impartial advice delivered through an online platform.

COVID-19 has forced businesses to rethink their operations, how they engage with staff and their use of technology. BeTheBusiness estimate that three years’ worth of digital transformation took place in three months  when the required public health measures began in March 202051. The UK is not in a unique position - globally 72% of SMEs have accelerated their digitisation rates in  light of COVID-1952.

Place matters. Many people are rooted to their local area because of its civic identity and their social and family connections: over 40% of workers have only ever worked in the same local area as they were born53. But there are parts of the country where people feel left-behind, that they are not getting fair access to jobs, wages and skills opportunities, and that their local priorities are not being delivered on by government. 
53  Bosquet and H.G. Overman (2019), ‘Why does birthplace matter so much?), (http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/100201/1/1_s2.0_S0094119019300117_

[Page #68]
Levelling up is about improving everyday life for people in those places. It is about ensuring people can be proud of their local community, rather than feeling as though they need to leave it in order to reach their potential.
This is why the UK Government’s most important mission is to unite and level up the country.  We want to improve everyday life for communities throughout the UK.  Where people live should not be a barrier to their life chances.

We are working closely with local authorities in every corner of the UK through the UK Shared Prosperity Fund, the Community Renewal Fund, the Community Ownership Fund, and the Levelling Up Fund to strengthen the connection between central government and citizens.
We will tackle geographical disparities in key services and outcomes across the UK: improving health, education, skills, increasing jobs and growth, building stronger and safer communities and improving infrastructure and connectivity. We will focus on boosting regional productivity where it is lagging to improve job opportunities and wages.  
Fundamentally, we are pursuing a new economic approach. We will: 
Our city regions are critical for driving economic growth and long-term prosperity. We want to achieve dynamic regional economies with high-value centres of excellence. The success of these are vital to the success of the wider region, including increasing the opportunities available for the towns and communities surrounding these cities.
 ■  unleash the potential of our great cities, 
ensuring they drive growth in every region and nation in the UK; 
 ■  invest in public services – the NHS, schools and colleges – to make them high quality everywhere in the country;
 ■  invest in towns across the UK, connecting people and places to high quality jobs, driving private sector investment, and creating places where people feel secure and feel proud to live
Some communities and towns are struggling, from ex-industrial areas to coastal communities. By improving access to services and the outcomes that matter most for life-chances, they will see social, economic and cultural regeneration. 
htworgro
All the themes in our plan for growth play a role in supporting our overarching mission to level up and unite the country.  
fnapruo
Above all, this is a plan that will build on the strengths of the Union.  The Union is core to our economic model and at the heart of our prosperity. We must therefore ensure the whole of the UK is firing on all cylinders. This means delivering on the infrastructure plans the government has set out for places across the UK, including through funding provided to the devolved administrations, and taking forward the Union Connectivity Review.

Supporting individuals       across the country  to reach their potential
First, the UK Government is focusing on supporting individuals in struggling towns to have the best possible life-chances by improving outcomes in education, skills, health, and participation in the workforce. Public services in these places often face more challenges than elsewhere and addressing these requires additional intervention to ensure they can best serve the needs of the community. We will use the UK Shared Prosperity Fund to target particular challenges facing individuals and communities in struggling towns across the UK, in collaboration with local authorities, and in a way that empowers local areas and strengthens local public services.
The most important pillar in our approach to levelling up is supporting individuals across the UK to reach their potential, investing in people in every place and region.  
Differences in levels of ‘human capital’ between places and regions, i.e. education, skills, health, are an important explainer of differences in regional outcomes. Research finds that up to 90% of area-level disparities in wages can be explained by the distribution of high-skilled workers54. 50% of the population in London have graduate-level qualifications, compared to 33% of the population in the North East of England. But more than this, people’s experience with health and education determine life-chances, wellbeing and social connection. In some places outcomes are poor, and this undermines belief that government can deliver for a community. We will strengthen these vital public services to address disparities in life-chances driven by key public services like health, education and skills. Some of the main themes of this investment are set out throughout this document.

Regenerating struggling towns
uB
People across the UK have lost out from structural economic changes simply because of where they live.  Our approach to tackling disadvantage in these struggling towns focuses on a three-pronged approach to support the regeneration of struggling towns, underpinned by world-class public services  to drive improved outcomes to improve  life-chances and deliver on our vision for every town across the UK to be safe,  healthy and prosperous.

[Page #71]
Second, we are delivering a step-change in how we support struggling towns by working in partnership with local institutions to invest in local priorities to support the local economy and improve quality of life, showing that government can deliver on local priorities such as improving local infrastructure, driving up the supply of housing where it is needed, and crime reduction. The £4.8 billion UK-wide Levelling Up Fund, will enable places to plan for their future. The Levelling Up Fund consolidates local growth funding streams, reducing the burden on places and breaking down siloes between UK Government departments. The prospectus for the Levelling Up Fund published alongside the Budget sets out how local areas across the UK can apply for funding to invest in local infrastructure priorities, with bids prioritised from places most in need of investment. Through the Towns Fund, we are also supporting the regeneration of towns across England. At Budget 2021, we are announcing 44 new Town Deals with towns across the country, investing in local priorities.

Towns Fund Case Study: Southport
The Government is investing £37.5 million in Southport through the Towns Fund, supporting Sefton Council and the Southport Town Deal Board to breathe new life into the town. 
Southport’s economy is characterised by a high proportion of part-time jobs in the retail, leisure and visitor economy which have been exposed to economic shocks both prior to and related to COVID-19.  A lack of all-weather, all year-round attractions has resulted in seasonality and a short summer season adding to the vulnerability in the sector. This is compounded by young people leaving the town as a result of the lack of opportunities.
With this funding from Government, Southport plans to create: 
 ■  up to 30,000 sqm of new and accessible public space, with priority for walking and cycling, 
to improve the connections between the waterfront and the town centre; 
 ■  a new world-class events centre, light fantastic display and all year-round attraction on  
the waterfront
htworgro
This infrastructure will improve the visitor experience on arrival; it will also help to create a year-round, all-weather economy that is not only more diverse but also provides opportunities for young people to see their future in the town and choose to stay. 
fnapruo
l
Third, we are also supporting private sector investment and new jobs in these communities: we are powering up local economies to ensure everyone can share in the prosperity of the UK. For example, the UK Government is backing the development of hydrogen hubs in the Tees 
Valley and Holyhead. This will build up the  UK’s capabilities in the green industries of the future and support the growth of green industrial clusters across coastal and  post-industrial communities.

Helping city regions        become globally  competitive
Cities are a fundamental driver of productivity growth. They play a critical role in the success of the wider region – successful regions benefit from strong cities to anchor growth. Our long-term vision is therefore for every region and nation of the UK to have at least 
one globally competitive city at its heart, helping to drive prosperity and increasing opportunity for all those who live nearby. 
But our regional cities underperform:

Successive governments have sought to address long-standing regional disparities. We will back cities as engines of the UK economy, focusing government action on addressing the barriers to growth. We will build strong, enduring partnerships with local institutions, such as universities, businesses and city leaders to deliver our shared vision of globally competitive regional cities, pulling up prosperity in the wider region.   
Liverpool City Region, West Midlands, West Yorkshire, Sheffield City Region, West of England and Tees Valley, subject to the creation of appropriate governance arrangements to agree and deliver funding. Budget 2021 takes the first step toward delivering the government’s commitment - confirming capacity funding in 2021-22 to support those city regions with appropriate governance arrangements already in place to begin preparations for settlements, enabling them to develop integrated investment-ready transport plans that will deliver on local priorities such as tackling congestion and  driving productivity. 
To achieve this vision, our core cities like Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow must become well-connected, innovative hubs of high-value activity. Government intervention can break down the barriers to this, ensuring strong local and regional transport links, planning policies fit for the future, excellent universities, and a business environment that supports dynamism and inward investment. We will bring to bear the full range of levers available to government, across skills, infrastructure, innovation, the business environment and finance to deliver this vision. 
We are investing in the National Home Building Fund (NHBF), with initial funding of £7.1 billion over the next four years to unlock up to 860,000 homes, including delivery of the Brownfield Fund, announced at Budget 2020 for Mayoral Combined Authorities like Greater Manchester and Liverpool City Region and an additional £100 million for non-Mayoral Combined Authorities in 2021-22. Almost £2.9 billion will be invested in City and Growth Deals to drive forward local economic priorities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

In addition, the government is investing £500 million, matched by industry, to deliver high-quality 4G mobile coverage from at least one operator across 95% of the UK by 2025, through the Shared Rural Network. This will have major benefits in rural areas, and for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
We are investing across digital and physical connectivity to support growth from corner to corner of the UK and ensure people do not have to relocate to succeed where they live.

We are delivering the largest ever investment in motorways and major A-roads worth over £27 billion between 2020 and 2025, as well as investing £1.7 billion in our local roads in the next 12 months. The Union Connectivity Review is reviewing options to improve our sea, air and land-links across the four nations. 
Changing the way  we invest in places

Delivering growth for the whole of the UK over the long-term means doing things differently. We recognise that the existing local institutional framework is complex and fragmented.

Local growth policies must be coherent and coordinated to maximise impact.

This is the context in which we are fundamentally re-wiring the way the UK Government delivers for places to ensure it better reflects the communities it serves. We have refreshed the Green Book to improve the understanding of the impacts of policies on places. We are relocating 22,000 Civil Service roles out of London and the South East by 2030 through the Places for Growth programme, bringing policy-makers closer to the communities they serve. HM Treasury will establish a new economic campus in the North of England, helping to shift policymaking away from Whitehall. We are relocating Civil Service jobs into Scotland, including to Queen Elizabeth House, the newly opened UK Edinburgh Hub. We are creating a new UK Infrastructure Bank in the North of England, and operating across the UK, to catalyse private investment in infrastructure projects.
Making sure our international strategy works for the whole UK
Openness to trade has allowed the UK to participate in and access specialised global supply chains delivering innovative, high-quality products such as smartphones and MRI scanners at more affordable prices. While UK consumers have benefited, this posed a particular challenge to areas with a substantial industrial base, newly exposed to international competition. We have an opportunity to shape our newly independent trade and investment policy to ensure it meets our domestic economic priorities, and that all regions can benefit.

The UK has long been at the forefront of tackling climate  change - the 2008 Climate Change Act was the first legislation in the world to provide a comprehensive framework to tackle global warming. In 2019 Parliament amended the act to commit the UK to net zero emissions by 2050. The UK is already a world leader in clean growth and has made considerable progress, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by over 40% between 1990 and  201955 while growing the economy by almost 80%. This has  been achieved while minimising cost and causing a net  reduction in average household energy bills.

The Treasury’s Net Zero Review will further consider where the UK might have comparative advantages and how the UK  can maximise the economic benefits from  the transition. Policies like those in the Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution  will have an important role in ensuring the  UK is able to make the most of those  potential opportunities.
Reaching our upcoming carbon budgets and net zero target will require significant investment and is a major opportunity for economic growth and job creation across  the country. The demand for low carbon goods and services will encourage new industries to emerge, with the potential to boost investment levels and productivity growth. Co-benefits from decarbonisation, such as improved air quality, can also be economically significant. 
li
uB
Future policies will set a clear direction for millions of people and businesses, shifting incentives to favour low carbon technologies and tackling barriers to action. Moving decisively in areas of comparative advantage could generate new future-proofed jobs and export opportunities, and establish the UK as a global leader across the low-carbon economy.

Carbon Capture Usage and Storage and Low Carbon Hydrogen
 ■  CCUS and hydrogen will play an important role in the UK achieving net zero emissions by 
2050. In recognition of this, the Ten Point Plan announced an aim to capture 10Mt CO2/year using CCUS and, working with industry, generate 5GW of hydrogen, both by 2030. 
 ■  To help achieve these targets, at Spending Review 2020, we increased the size of the CCUS Infrastructure Fund to support the deployment of four CCUS clusters, two by the mid-2020s and a further two by 2030. This has the potential to support up to 50,000 jobs by 2030 in some of the country’s industrial heartlands, in areas such as the North East, the Humber, the North West, Scotland and Wales. The UK Government recently published further information on business models for CCUS56. 
 ■  The UK Government also announced £240 million for the low carbon hydrogen fund to  
help develop the UK’s hydrogen capacity, whilst supporting up to 8,000 jobs across the UK. We will bring forward a Hydrogen Strategy and hydrogen business models to drive private sector investment later in 2021.

Ensuring the finance  sector can play its role 
Prioritising our  natural environment
We are taking action to fulfil our commitment to be the first generation to leave the natural environment in a better condition than we found it. The first round of the £80 million Green Recovery Challenge Fund is already supporting green jobs and nature recovery through 68 successful project applications. Meanwhile, the Nature for Climate Fund will scale-up tree planting and peatland restoration in England, harnessing the power of nature in support of net zero. We are taking advantage of our new freedoms to fundamentally reform our system of farm payments in England to prioritise climate and environmental benefits while boosting productivity and animal welfare. And we are progressing major waste reforms which will drive new jobs and investment in a more circular economy. 
As the Chancellor set out in his vision for financial services, the UK Government’s ambition is for a greener industry, using innovation and finance to tackle climate change and protect our environment. The UK Government intends to fully implement a ‘Green Taxonomy’ to provide a common standard for measuring firms’ environmental impact and will require firms to disclose the climate risks they face in line with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). We have joined the International Platform on Sustainable Finance to ensure standards can operate internationally. We are ensuring the remits of both the Monetary Policy Committee and the Financial Policy Committee reflect the UK Government’s economic strategy for delivering an environmentally sustainable net zero economy, and that market participants have the skills they need by launching the Green Finance Education Charter and its toolkit. We will issue the UK’s first sovereign green bond this summer, with a further issuance to follow later in 2021 as the UK looks to quickly build out a green yield curve in the coming years. Green gilt issuance in the financial year 2021-22 will be a minimum of £15 billion.

These green gilts will help fund critical projects to tackle climate change and other environmental challenges, finance important infrastructure investment, and create green jobs across the country. In addition, the UK will issue a green retail product linked to the green gilt programme, providing all UK savers with the opportunity to take part in the collective effort to tackle climate change.

Creating deliverable plans  to meet our targets
Ensuring the route to  net zero creates jobs
The Ten Point Plan has laid the foundation for a Green Industrial Revolution that will work with industry to help deliver our net zero target. Further progress on deliverable plans for sectors will follow in the coming year. The Energy White Paper built on the Ten Point Plan, providing further detail on how the energy sector can support the economic recovery while transitioning to net zero. Other sector strategies such as the Heat and Buildings Strategy, Transport Decarbonisation Plan and Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy will be published in due course, followed by the Net Zero Strategy later in the year. The Treasury’s Net Zero Review will consider further how the UK can maximise the economic benefits of the transition and ensure an equitable balance  of contributions from households, businesses and taxpayers.
Regardless of the size or direction of the impact on the economy, the transition will lead to structural changes. Employment opportunities in green industries will emerge, while high carbon sectors will have to adapt. Some of these effects will be regionally concentrated. New green jobs are already appearing in sectors such as offshore wind, with growth and opportunities centred around regional clusters. Targeted investments in strategically important sectors will help enable a more sustainable long-term path, while protecting jobs and supporting levelling up across the UK.

Case studies of sectors in transition to net zero
l
Automotive - To support the UK’s electric vehicle manufacturing industry, the UK Government has committed to spend nearly £500 million in the next four years, as part of our commitment to provide up to £1 billion for the development and mass-scale production of electric vehicle batteries and associated EV supply chain. This funding is available UK wide and will boost investment into the UK’s strong manufacturing bases.
Aerospace - The Jet Zero Council is a partnership between industry and UK Government to drive the delivery of new technologies and innovative ways to cut aviation emissions. It launched in 2020, with the aim of delivering net zero aviation by 2050. Earlier this year UK Government and industry announced an £84.6 million investment to develop zero-emissions flights, using alternative energy sources of hydrogen or electricity, which have the potential to unlock nearly 5,000 jobs across the UK.
Agriculture - The Agricultural Transition Plan published in November sets out our ambition for a renewed agricultural sector in which farming and the countryside make a significant contribution to our climate and environmental goals. To support this transition, we are maintaining the current annual budget to farmers throughout this Parliament while phasing in Environmental Land Management and other new schemes that will support increased agricultural sustainability and productivity.
Oil and Gas - The UK Government will provide £27 million for the Aberdeen Energy Transition Zone, helping to support North East Scotland to play a leading role in meeting the UK’s net zero ambitions. A further £5 million for the Global Underwater Hub, on top of the £1.3 million committed last year, and up to £2 million to further develop industry proposals for the North Sea Transition Deal will support areas like Aberdeen transition to a low-carbon future.

The net impact of the transition on local labour markets will depend on the costs of decarbonising for individual firms and the flexibility of the labour market to match vacancies with the necessary skills. The investment and demand for low carbon goods and services will also require innovation and encourage new industries to emerge, creating jobs across the country. The Treasury’s Net Zero Review will assess how the UK can maximise economic growth opportunities from its transformation to a green economy, as well as mechanisms to create an equitable balance of contributions from households, businesses and taxpayers. The Green Jobs Taskforce forms part of the Ten Point Plan, and the government will work in partnership with businesses, skills providers and unions to develop plans as we transition to a high-skill, low carbon economy.
Encouraging others  to follow our lead
Tackling climate change and reversing biodiversity loss is a global challenge. As the recently published independent Dasgupta Review on the Economics of Biodiversity highlights, protecting and enhancing our natural assets, and the biodiversity that underpins them, will also be crucial to achieving a sustainable, resilient economies globally. The UK led the world in becoming the first major economy to legislate to eliminate our net contribution to climate change by 2050. It is critical that we work with our international partners to ensure the world follows our lead. Through our upcoming Presidency of COP26, and our Presidency of the G7, the UK Government is putting tackling climate change and environmental issues at the top of the international agenda. We have announced that we will end direct government support for the fossil fuel energy sector overseas, including trade promotion, export finance and aid funding, other than for a limited range of exceptions. To support our international partners to meet the global challenge, we have committed to providing at least £11.6 billion in International Climate Finance (ICF) support to developing countries between 2021 and 2025. As the world moves towards net zero, there will be opportunities for innovative UK industries to grow and export their expertise.

The UK’s prosperity is built on our integration into the global economic and financial system. An open economy, which permits the free flow of ideas, goods, services and data based on adherence to a mutually agreed set of rules and principles, will drive long-term prosperity and innovation. It provides UK consumers, businesses, producers, workers and investors with access to cheaper, better quality goods and services, offering greater choice, creating jobs and freeing up resources for innovation and investment at home. In 2019-20, new inward investment projects supported over 56,000 jobs across the UK57.
However, the open global economy is facing significant challenges. Global economic growth has been slower since the 2008-09 financial crisis and the pace of globalisation – openness to trade and investment – has stalled. Momentum for trade liberalisation is slowing and cases of protectionism increasing, in part due to states’ more aggressive use of trade policy as a lever in international competition. COVID-19 may accelerate the trend towards more regional and national approaches, although trade flows recovered relatively quickly following the initial shock. 
We will use our global influence and all the policy levers available to us to demonstrate the benefits of openness, propose and develop solutions to challenges facing the international order. We will build agile alliances and coalitions of likeminded partners to create global action that will deliver on our  domestic priorities.
The UK’s success as a trading nation will depend on its ability to use its comparative strengths to anticipate evolving demand at both a country and sector level. Trends such as continued rapid growth in emerging economies, the expansion of the global middle class, as well as the growing demand and increasing tradability of more sophisticated sectors of the global economy all provide potential opportunities for UK businesses. Openness to international markets ensures UK access to multiple diverse sources of supply for the goods and services we need, improving the resilience of our supply chains and benefitting prosperity. According to the OECD, a 10 percentage point increase in trade exposure is associated with a 4% increase in income per head.

As the upcoming Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy (Integrated Review) will set out, our international actions support and underpin our domestic goals. Our infrastructure, skills, and innovation will benefit from an open and resilient international system and our integration within it. At the same time, our global leadership derives strength from our ambitious positions on the issues of the day, including important priorities such as climate, digital, or services.

    We have transitioned trade agreements 
with 64 countries, securing existing relationships preferences and supply chains. This includes agreements with Japan, Turkey, Vietnam and Singapore, which together accounted for £71 billion of UK trade in 2019.

Case study: UK Global Tariff
On 31 December 2020 the UK Government implemented the UK Global Tariff (UKGT). Replacing the EU’s Common External Tariff (CET), it is the UK’s first independent tariff schedule in almost 50 years and applies to all goods imported from trading partners that we do not have a preferential trading agreement arrangement with (such as a Free Trade Agreement). 
l
The UKGT was designed to support growth:  it is generally simpler, easier to use and lower than the EU’s CET, and it is in pounds not euros. It has been tailored to the needs of the UK economy, supporting businesses and their supply chains by making it easier and cheaper to import goods from overseas. 
7979
rertettetBeBkckacBaBdduBuB
The UKGT almost doubles the number of tariff lines that have zero import tariffs relative to the CET – with just under 50% of products lines now zero-rated compared to 27% in the EU’s CET. Specifically, the UKGT: 
lili
 ■  removes tariffs on around £30 billion worth of imports of inputs to production,  
supporting supply chains for UK businesses;
 ■  removes tariffs on £10 billion worth of imports that have little to no UK production,  
lowering costs for UK consumers58;
 ■  removes tariffs on 100 ‘green goods’ to promote a sustainable economy,  
e.g. removing tariffs on thermostats, vacuum flasks and LED lamps;
 ■  removes all ‘nuisance tariffs’ below 2%, e.g. on fire extinguishers and school pencils,  
cutting down on red tape;
 ■   simplifies by rounding tariffs down into set bands (e.g. reading glasses from 2.9% to  2% and alarm clocks from 4.7% to 4%) and removing the complex tariff calculations
The UK Government has sought to balance objectives by maintaining tariffs on certain  sensitive products, to underpin our free trade agreement ambitions and to protect  preferential access for developing nations. This includes certain agricultural products,  road vehicles and ceramics.

Ensuring the UK remains       a leading destination  for global investment
Inward investment brings economic benefits to the UK – in 2019-20 inward investment created over 56,000 jobs across the UK, of which over three quarters were outside London59– and it can also play a role in supporting the UK Government’s key priorities, such as levelling up and net zero. The UK is open for investment and continues to encourage and support investors from around the world. The Government is committed to ensuring that the UK continues to be one of the top destinations in the world for investment. 
The UK Government has established a new Office for Investment which is now operational. It will support high value investment opportunities into the UK which align with key government priorities, including our focus on key sectors, reaching net zero, investment in infrastructure and advancing research and development.

These outcomes are now being embedded by departments into Outcome Delivery Plans, which will set out strategy and planning information for delivering the priority outcomes and for delivering on strategic “enabling” activities that are crucial to successful delivery. A new focused performance reporting system at the centre will provide an ongoing picture of departmental activity, with regular reporting to the Cabinet Office and HM Treasury on progress enabling greater shared understanding of performance and early action where delivery is off track. This information will support decisions made at future Spending Reviews, creating a greater link between financial allocations and the delivery of real-world outcomes that matter  to citizens.

The Prime Minister has also refreshed the Cabinet Committee structure to reflect the Government’s priorities and to drive the delivery of the plan for growth. The Prime Minister will chair the new National Economy and Recovery Taskforce with a focus on catalysing growth, levelling up across the UK and driving public service performance and delivery.  A new National Economy and Recovery Taskforce (Public Services) committee chaired by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster will focus on public sector recovery and reform, and the Better Regulation Committee (BRC) chaired by the Chancellor of the Exchequer will coordinate an ambitious programme of regulatory reform over the parliament.

We must ensure our plan is carried through with a relentless focus on delivery. To drive this, the Prime Minister and Cabinet Secretary have asked Sir Michael Barber to conduct a rapid review of government delivery to ensure that it remains focused, effective and efficient, and to suggest how it could be strengthened.

This review builds on reforms to the government’s planning and performance framework already underway that aim to embed a new focus on the delivery of outcomes. As part of implementing the Public Value Framework (PVF)64, the UK Government published provisional priority outcomes and metrics for UK government departments alongside SR2065. These outcomes capture the government’s long-term policy objectives, including the people’s priorities of levelling-up, net zero and global Britain. This plan details how the UK Government will deliver them through economic growth.

Annex: Opportunities  for growth from EU exit
The UK’s departure from the European Union presents opportunities for us to do things differently and better going forward. We have already acted in a number of areas, for example, establishing the new Points Based System on migration and replacing the Common Agricultural Policy. We can capitalise on new regulatory and policy freedoms, and on the UK’s ability to operate on the international stage, finding new ways to drive growth that will enable us to achieve our priority outcomes.
 ■  Building our strongest sectors: Ending the Transition Period gives us the ability to supercharge the sectors where we already have competitive advantage, driving economic growth, unleashing investment, creating jobs, and building on our international competitiveness in sectors such as financial services and fintech, automotive, digital, green energy and the creative industries. For example, in Life Sciences, the UK can offer unique opportunities to global companies: we are one of the world’s best research and science bases, underpinned by top class universities, globally renowned clinical research and a uniquely cradle to grave healthcare system in the NHS. New freedoms from being outside of the EU will allow the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to become a globally leading innovative, regulator, acting as an enabler for innovation – as demonstrated by the swift work in approving COVID-19 vaccines. 
htworgro
 ■  Attracting the brightest and best: Taking back control of our borders means we decide who can come to the UK, as demonstrated by the new, global Points Based System. Our fairer, firmer and skills-led migration system, with further targeted reforms to high-skilled visa routes planned this year, will enable companies to attract recognised and high-potential talent from around the world, creating jobs and driving growth in the UK.

 ■  Making the most of regulatory flexibility:  Our newfound control of our laws will free the UK to regulate and support our industries in a way that suits our specific needs and creates a dynamic and competitive economy that is fit for the future. We can stimulate growth, innovation and competition in the UK, whilst attracting new investment, enabling businesses to grow dynamically, and maintaining the high standards that the UK has consistently championed. For example, our Transforming Public Procurement green paper shows how we will speed up and simplify our processes and unleash opportunities for small businesses. We will regulate technologies in an innovation-friendly way, driving growth by boosting competition, keeping people safe and secure, and promoting our democratic values.  
 ■  Driving growth across the whole UK: We are replacing the overly bureaucratic EU Structural Funds with a new UK Shared Prosperity Fund that will be used to bind together the whole of the United Kingdom, tackling poor outcomes and spreading opportunity in each of the four nations. We are introducing Freeports which will become hives of entrepreneurialism, trade and investment, and we are ensuring that UK companies can trade unhindered in every part of the UK while maintaining world-leading standards for consumers and workers. An agile, futureproofed UK economy with an ambitious global agenda will enable us to level up towns, regions and nations across the whole of the United Kingdom, boosting jobs and ensuring every place shares in the prosperity of the UK.

Annex: Opportunities  
for growth from EU exit
 ■  A world leader in free trade: Internationally, the UK will operate an independent trade policy for the first time in 50 years. We have introduced the UK Global Tariff tailored to the needs of the UK economy, almost doubling the number of goods that are tariff free relative to the EU Common External Tariff, and supporting businesses and their supply chains by making it easier and cheaper to import goods from overseas. We will use our independent voice at the World Trade Organization to champion free and fair trade, the rules based international system, and promote openness and cooperation in the face of collective challenges. The new Free Trade Agreements we strike – like those we are already negotiating with the US, Australia and New Zealand – will increase our trade with the rest of the world, create new opportunities for our exporters and deliver better choice and value for our consumers.  
 ■  Supercharging green growth: The UK will also set its own climate and energy policies, based on our ambitious domestic and international climate objectives. We want to break away from the pack with ambitious targets and faster progress. The landmark Environment Bill will tackle the biggest environmental priorities of our time and change the way we protect and enhance our precious natural resources in England. The Bill will require the government to set long-term legally binding environmental targets, establishing a new independent public body, the Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) to hold the UK Government to account. The Environment Bill will also introduce a number of measures for England further improving our environment, from mandatory Biodiversity Net Gain and Local Nature Recovery Strategies, to the power to introduce a Deposit Return Scheme and increase our resource efficiency. We are actively exploring opportunities to cut emissions and boost innovation in the aviation sector, including through the Jet Zero Council and the CAA consultation on opportunities for UK General Aviation. We are replacing the Common Agricultural Policy with a system in England that will enable better environmental outcomes. By taking back control of our territorial waters, we will be able to manage our fisheries and precious marine environment in a more sustainable way.
