Ministerial Foreword
The ﬁrst generation of quantum technologies created many innovations that wenow take for granted in modern society, from the MRI machine to mobile devices.Yet there are lesser known but equally powerful inventions emerging from UK labsthat could change our world beyond recognition.
These inventions will improve the lives of everyone in the UK, from improvinghealthcare and speeding up drug discovery, to boosting economic growth andsecurity and providing jobs. They will also help us tackle climate change, build asustainable future for our children, and help the UK to respond to growing globalvolatility, as set out in the government’s Integrated Review Refresh.
Quantum rewrites the rules of classical physics, and in doing so allows us to dothings previously thought impossible. Take, for example, exquisitely sensitive brainscanners that will reveal new insights into epilepsy or dementia, or sensors that letus see what lies beneath the ground from the surface. These are already beingused in real-world settings today.
In 2023, the government created the Department for Science, Innovation andTechnology (DSIT) to deliver our mission to be the most innovative economy in theworld and a science and technology superpower. Quantum technologies are at thecore of this mission, not only as one of our ﬁve priority technologies of tomorrow –quantum, AI, engineering biology, semiconductors, future telecoms – but also as atechnology that could release the full potential of every other on that list.

The UK is already a global leader in quantum technologies. In 2014 we set up theNational Quantum Technologies Programme, the ﬁrst of its kind in the world, tosupport excellent research and begin to take technologies out of the researchenvironment. The UK’s highly collaborative quantum community reﬂects thatforesight from nearly ten years ago. The UK has world-leading strengths inquantum, including our deep research talent, the knowledge built up across thedifferent quantum technologies, our rapidly growing quantum sector, and ourstrengths throughout quantum and related supply chains.
We are determined to build on these strengths with vision and long-term fundingcertainty. This national strategy sets out our new ten-year ambitious commitment toquantum technologies in the UK. We ﬁrmly believe that Britain should lead theworld in this physical science and deliver opportunities and jobs in hardware,engineering and advanced manufacturing as well as in software and applicationsacross the economy. As part of our new department’s ethos of taking immediateaction backed up by strong long-term planning, we are more than doubling ourinvestment into quantum by investing £2.5 billion in quantum over the next tenyears, with the aim of attracting signiﬁcant additional private investment on top ofthat.
This ten year plan will fund new frontiers of quantum research, support and developour growing quantum sector, prepare our wider economy for the quantum revolutionand ensure that the UK leads internationally in the regulation and ethical use ofquantum technologies. We will make the UK the home for cutting-edge scientiﬁcbreakthroughs, the best place in the world to start and grow a quantum business, aleading voice in the international quantum and tech community, and a magnet forinternational quantum talent.
We have worked hand in hand with the UK quantum community to bring thisnational strategy to fruition; I would like to thank everyone who has contributed tothis process. The hard work starts now to deliver on its goals together.
The Rt Hon Michelle Donelan MPSecretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology
Executive Summary
Over the next ten years, quantum technologies will revolutionise many aspects oflife in the UK and bring enormous beneﬁts to the UK economy, society and the waywe can protect our planet. The UK has a world-leading position and quantum is oneof the top priorities for the government, as set out in the Integrated Review Refresh.This strategy sets out our plan for the next ten years, building on the successes todate, to realise the incredible potential of these technologies for the UK.
Quantum technologies take advantage of phenomena at the atomic scale to ﬁndnew ways to manipulate information. These technologies will one day make itpossible to solve complex problems that are currently impossible to solve with eventhe most powerful high-performance classical computer and will allow us to reachentirely new frontiers in sensing, timing, imaging and communications.

Quantum technologies already offer possible solutions to some of our greatestsocietal challenges and, perhaps most excitingly, offer future capabilities that areyet to be explored. They will improve lives, drive economic growth and create jobs,and make us more secure.
The exponential increase in computing power from quantum computers couldrevolutionise our healthcare system - from dramatically improved drug discoverytechniques to providing personalised treatment to an individual based on geneticand environmental factors -, help to manage and make best use of our nationalenergy infrastructure, and even accelerate the path to autonomy and entirelynew AI applications. It could deliver on our sustainability goals by improving solarpanels and batteries as well as cutting the energy demands of data centres.Over the next three to ﬁve years, quantum computing could deliver $5-10 billionof beneﬁts across the world; and this rises to $450-$850 billion in the next ﬁfteento thirty years. [footnote 1]Quantum sensing and imaging can provide unprecedented insight about whatlies beneath the ground - saving billions in environmental monitoring and onlarge-scale construction projects -, open new ways to diagnose and treat diseaseand monitor and reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are invisible to thehuman eye. Quantum sensing could generate at least $5 billion in revenue by2030 [footnote 2].Quantum clocks and communication could help us develop new navigation andtiming capabilities without the need for a satellite link, providing even greaterresilience for railways, telecommunications and emergency services - as well ashelping to secure the global communications network against cybercrime.Quantum communications could account for an estimated $8 billion in revenueby 2030 [footnote 3].
Those countries that are amongst the ﬁrst to develop quantum technologies, anduse them widely across the economy, will have vast advantages in terms ofproductivity, economic growth, health, sustainability, and national security andresilience, not least because of the anticipated ability of quantum computers toundermine cryptography used to secure the internet. This means that quantum is apriority technology for the government, and one that will remain critically importantfor our economic growth, economic security, national security and defence. We arein a global race to develop and commercialise these capabilities. The UK was anearly mover, but other countries are accelerating their own efforts. Investing inquantum now, building on the strengths that we have already established, willensure that we deliver on quantum technologies for the UK.
Building on strong foundations
We have already made great progress in the UK, with a £1 billion investment inresearch and development from 2014. [footnote 4] Over its 10-year lifetime, thisprogramme has built leading capabilities in quantum computing, sensors andtiming, imaging and communications, and helped to build their path to market. As aresult, the UK has considerable strengths and opportunities in quantum:

We have invested in quantum skills, funding postgraduate research andfellowships, and have some of the world’s leading quantum experts. Our talent isa key draw to locate a quantum business in the UK.We have a rapidly growing quantum sector - we rank second in the world to theUS for the number of quantum companies and second in attracting privateinvestment, leading the competition in Europe. [footnote 5]The UK’s developing quantum sector has a broad range of capabilities, withcompanies across the range of quantum technologies – computing,communications, sensing, imaging, and timing. We are also acknowledged asworld-leading in developing quantum computing software for error correction andapplications.We have industrial strengths in the supply chain, in areas such as photonics,electronics and cryogenics, which are essential to quantum technologies. Wehave world leading clusters, such as the compound semiconductor cluster inSouth Wales, and a long-established photonics cluster in Scotland.The extent of collaboration within the quantum community in the UK is aparticular and rare strength. The government has funded 139 projects involving141 quantum organisations through the Innovate UK Commercialising QuantumChallenge alone. [footnote 6] The interplay between the different elements of thecommunity in the UK – from hardware, to software, to components and enablers– is particularly strong.Our testing and assurance capabilities, through the National Physical Laboratory,are among the best in the world and a key enabler for the sector.We also have key user sector strengths, for example, in space, ﬁnance,aerospace, defence and life sciences, which provide a strong domestic marketfor quantum technologies.We are also strong in other technologies, such as artiﬁcial intelligence, highperformance computing, space, telecoms, and engineering biology, which whenintegrated with quantum technologies could boost capabilities and impact.
Government investments to date through the National Quantum TechnologiesProgramme have created a unique and diverse pool of talent, capabilities andknow-how within our quantum sector. However, given the pace of change globallyand the challenge of bringing quantum into widespread use, it is the right time toset out a clear ambition and funding certainty for the next ten years to capitalise onthis leading position and to accelerate the path to commercialisation.
This strategy sets out a bold and ambitious approach to supporting quantumtechnologies in the UK across the broad spectrum of quantum computing, sensing,timing, imaging and communications. We will develop UK strengths across differenthardware platforms, software and components, and reinforce our capabilitiesthroughout the supply chains. Although international collaboration is an essentialpart of our approach, it is not in the UK’s interests to rely purely on others foraccess to these critical technologies. We will also invest in and strengthen the keyecosystem enablers, such as skills, infrastructure, regulation and standards. Wewill monitor the development of these technologies, both in the UK and in other

countries, and the development of the market, to ensure we can ﬂex our approachto deliver the best possible outcome for the UK.
A new ten-year vision, plan and commitment
Our vision is for the UK to be a leading quantum-enabled economy by 2033, with aworld leading sector, and where quantum technologies are an integral part of theUK’s future digital infrastructure and advanced manufacturing base, driving growthand helping to build a thriving and resilient economy and society.
To achieve this we will commit £2.5 billion to developing quantum technologies inthe UK over the ten years from 2024 - more than doubling current publicinvestment, which will aim to generate an additional £1 billion of private investmentinto the programme. This programme will:
Ensure the UK is home to world-leading quantum science and engineering,growing UK knowledge and skillsSupport business, making the UK the go-to place for quantum businesses andan integral part of the global supply chain, as well as a preferred location forinvestors and global talentDrive the adoption and use of quantum technologies in the UK to deliver beneﬁtsfor the economy and society, as well as our national securityCreate a national and international regulatory framework that supports innovationand the ethical use of quantum technologies, and protects UK capabilities andnational security
This strategy sets out a ten-year vision, plan and priority actions. As quantumtechnologies develop, the UK will need to make some key strategic decisions aboutwhere to focus efforts to realise the beneﬁts from these technologies. At this earlystage it is important to continue to build the science, grow the vibrant ecosystem,explore a range of technology platforms and parts of the supply chain where the UKhas world leading strengths, in addition to focussing on software and use caseexploration. But it’s also important to be more targeted where and when we can,working with industry to accelerate development within high value applications asthey emerge to grow a world class quantum sector and deliver beneﬁts for theeconomy and society.
We will therefore develop our priority actions over time within the wider programmebased on progress and wider trends, in full consultation with the UK quantumcommunity. We will report regularly to the National Science and TechnologyCouncil, chaired by the Prime Minister, and publish an annual report on progress.

Introduction: Quantum Technologies in theUK
What are quantum technologies?
Many technologies that are part of our everyday life are based on our knowledge ofquantum mechanics, from the lasers that are used in smartphones or for moderntelecommunications, to superconducting devices which have revolutionised medicalimaging.
Today, second-generation quantum technologies make the realisation of entirelynew advances possible, based on the ability to generate, detect and controlquantum states. We are on the cusp of a new wave of innovation that will offer astep change in performance from an unprecedented increase in compute power, toexquisitely precise sensors, and enhanced communications.
The advantages that these enabling quantum technologies will offer, alongside AI,high performance computing (HPC), and a broader suite of technologies, willtransform how we interact with the world. Such technologies hold the potential toincrease resilience, national security, productivity and competitiveness across manycritical sectors including health, cyber security and defence and help tackle some ofthe biggest challenges that we face. Quantum technologies also pose potentialnational security challenges, not least the expectation that quantum computers willbe capable of undermining the cryptography used to secure internet data.
The physical properties of nature at the atomic or subatomic level, andquantum systems, are both incredibly susceptible to outside interference (whichcreates exquisitely sensitive sensors or precise clocks), and exhibit novelproperties (like the ability to link particles (entanglement), or for them to existin multiple states (superposition)) which means they offer novel ways ofstoring, processing and sending information. Quantum technologies use thesequantum effects to, for example, perform computation, create images of

objects, sense the size, shape or movement of an object, or provide a timingsignal.
The UK has an exceptional history in modern quantum physics, from the seminaltheoretical work of Artur Ekert in the early 1990s that showed that encrypted keyscan be secured by quantum systems, to the cutting-edge technologies now beingdeveloped in our research organisations and businesses.
The National Quantum Technologies Programme
The UK’s visionary National Quantum Technologies Programme (NQTP)(https://uknqt.ukri.org/), ﬁrst formed in 2014, has brought together government,academia and industry to bring the promising science of quantum into widersociety. It has invested:
£214 million in research through the Quantum Research Hubs, a nationalnetwork of four university-led Quantum Technology Hubs, funded by theEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), to accelerateprogress towards the development and commercialisation of quantumtechnologies across communications, sensors and timing, enhanced imagingand computing. [footnote 7] These Hubs involve over 30 research organisationsspread across the UK [footnote 8], bringing critical mass in an engaged ecosystem.£184 million (including an additional £10 million granted in 2023) to supportuniversities and companies to work together to research and develop quantumtechnologies through the Commercialising Quantum Technologies Challenge,delivered by Innovate UK, that is funding industry-led projects to develop newproducts and technologies based on advances in quantum science; [footnote 9]£93 million in the National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC), a new researchinstitution funded through UKRI, that is driving activities to build a scalablequantum computer in the UK; [footnote 10]the Quantum Metrology Institute at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) thatprovides a national capability in testing, evaluating and accelerating thecommercialisation of quantum technologies, as well as leading for the NQTP inthe development of international standards;a Quantum Technologies for Fundamental Physics programme that aims to applyquantum technologies to investigate fundamental questions about the universe;investments in graduate training to produce regular cohorts of highly qualiﬁedquantum researchers, through dedicated Centres for Doctoral Training (CDTs);alongside, MoD has funded a number of Defence Science and TechnologyLaboratory (Dstl) programmes associated with the NQTP for research intodefence applications of quantum.
The National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC)
The National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC) is a new research institutionfunded through UKRI, which is dedicated to accelerating the development of

quantum computing by addressing the challenges of scalability and readiness.Working with partners across industry, government and the researchcommunity, the NQCC will create the necessary R&D capabilities throughcoordination and delivery of a technical programme, alongside thecommissioning and operation of new facilities.
The programme will deliver assured quantum computing capability, enablingthe UK to remain internationally competitive. The centre will be headquarteredin a purpose-built facility at the STFC’s Rutherford Appleton Laboratory campusin Oxfordshire, which is due for completion in 2023.
UK Strengths
Today, the UK has a thriving academic and industrial quantum community.
Regional centres of excellence exist up and down the country, from the NationalQuantum Computing Centre (NQCC) in Harwell, to the National PhysicalLaboratory (NPL) in Teddington, the Fraunhofer Centre for Applied Photonics inGlasgow, to our four research hubs led by the Universities of York, Birmingham,Glasgow, and Oxford. These centres and their communities have built wide-rangingnetworks, bringing together experts from universities, national laboratories, andindustry partners to collaborate on quantum science and technologies. Thisecosystem is widely admired and emulated by other countries as it has built avibrant collaborative enterprise, connecting great research to translation andcommercialisation.
The National Hubs in quantum science and technologies have claimed many worldﬁrsts since the programme began, such as the ﬁrst industrial demonstrations of aquantum gravimeter (capable of sensing underground objects), the ﬁrst chip-to-chipQuantum Key Distribution (QKD) encrypted transmission, and achieving worldrecord performance in ion trap quantum computing. The UK is in the top ﬁve in arange of metrics for global academic excellence [footnote 11].
Quantum Sensors and Timing
Despite our increasing ability to detect and monitor things that exist on land,sea or in space, we still often resort to digging or drilling holes to ﬁnd objectssuch as forgotten pipes and cabling or to locate and measure sinkholes andmine workings. Researchers from the EPSRC-supported UK National QuantumHub in Sensors and Timing and Defence Science and Technology Laboratory(Dstl) have teamed up with specialist environmental engineering company, RSKand Teledyne e2V to develop a new ground mapping technology, a ‘quantumgravity gradiometer’. The device works by detecting variations in microgravityusing the principles of quantum physics. This was tested outside the lab for theﬁrst time in 2022, successfully detecting a hidden underground object. Faster,cheaper, and much more reliable than current systems, the technology changes

the game, reducing the time needed for surveys, for example, from a month toa few days.
The programme has led to the successful transfer of knowledge and technologyinto many UK companies; generating and supporting around 50 quantumtechnology start-ups; nurturing a highly skilled quantum workforce, including over470 PhD candidates and many fellowships; attracting more venture capitalinvestment per capita into quantum technology than any other country [footnote 12].
New quantum devices that have been developed in the UK across computing,communications, sensing and timing are now being trialled globally, from wearablebrain scanners that will improve our understanding of neurological disorders, tominiaturised atomic clocks that will end dependence on satellites for timing which iscritical for everything from healthcare to navigation and ﬁnancial services.
Recent developments in the sector show that the UK is an innovative centre for thecommercialisation and deployment of quantum technologies. These include thelaunch of the ﬁrst commercial trial of a quantum secured communication service inLondon, the integration of quantum gas cameras into monitoring systems in the oiland gas industry, and the release of a platform agnostic quantum computingoperating system.
The UK is now home to the largest number of quantum start-ups in Europe. [footnote13] It attracts more capital investment than any other country in Europe [footnote 14].Businesses supported by the UK Commercialising Quantum Challenge have raisedover £425 million in private sector ﬁnancing since the programme began. [footnote 15]
Over 120 UK businesses partner with the UK national research hubs in quantumtechnologies [footnote 16] and, in recognition of this connected community, a numberof international quantum companies have chosen to locate operations in the UK.We also have leading businesses across the supply chain (including lasers,cryogenic systems, high vacuum equipment, electronic control systems and photondetectors) who are winning contracts in the UK and exporting to the quantumcommunity in global markets.
More broadly, the UK is a major pull for global talent, investment and collaborationdue to our global reputation for R&D excellence, an innovative and transparentregulatory environment, world-class intellectual property and competitive taxregimes, as well as dedicated visa schemes for innovative companies. The UK isalso home to high R&D investment sectors that are essential in the development ofemerging technologies, such as advanced manufacturing, automotive, aerospaceand ﬁnance.
Challenges
As demonstrated above, the potential applications of quantum technologies arevast. This is both an opportunity and a challenge, with the sheer range of possibleuses meaning it often takes time and considerable expertise for prospective users

to understand the potential of the technology and focus on the most impactfulapplication.
Other challenges speciﬁc to quantum technologies include:
The technology is still emerging. For quantum computing, which is further fromthe market than other applications, there is still uncertainty around whichtechnical approach will prove to be the most effective to solving the scientiﬁc andengineering challenge. It is also important to understand the interplay betweenquantum hardware and software, as well as supply chains speciﬁc to eachtechnical approach, in order to build a strong UK capability. In other areas, suchas sensing and timing, although a step change in performance can bedemonstrated in a lab, it is not always clear when quantum will be the preferredsolution in real-world settings.We are still in the early days of commercialising quantum, with most quantumtechnologies in the research, development or early demonstration phase.Developing quantum products and services can be a long and challengingprocess, with the need for sustained investment and support before proﬁts canbe made.The quantum sector must compete with more established sectors to accesspackaging and fabrication capabilities, challenging when companies are havingto undertake exploratory design cycles in small batches. As with other deep techsectors, the capital requirement for research, development and deployment ofproducts is considerable. This challenge is likely to increase in the coming yearsas products get closer to market and companies require more access toexpensive infrastructure and commercial scale packaging and fabricationfacilities.Demand for quantum skills outstrips supply, despite sustained investment in theUK. Competition for skills is increasing, with recent analysis showing that globallyquantum job adverts outstrip qualiﬁed talent by as much as three to one [footnote17], and salaries for top quantum professionals are more than double the UKaverage in the US. [footnote 18]Global investment and competition are increasing at a rapid pace and scale. TheUK is working within a changing geopolitical context with other governmentsramping up investment into their national research programmes - with funding ofat least $15 billion in China, and $7.2 billion in the European Union [footnote 19],with the US now spending around $820 million a year [footnote 20], and Japanrecently doubling its annual expenditure to around $590 million in 2022. [footnote21]
Large corporations headquartered overseas have also established signiﬁcantquantum programmes. This increase in activity means that UK companies facetougher competition for talent and have to be aware of the potential risksassociated with technology transfer and trade restrictions.

National Quantum Strategy (accessible webpage) - GOV.UK
The UK is in a strong position to play a world-leading role in quantum technologies,if we can overcome the challenges outlined above (many of which are shared byother nations). We have strategic choices about the approach we take across thedifferent quantum technologies:
For quantum computing, our ambition is for the UK to support the development ofand access to state-of-the-art and eventually fully scalable machines in order toexplore beneﬁcial applications for the economy and society and undertakeresearch. At the same time this will give the UK quantum sector the bestopportunity to capture a signiﬁcant share of the global market creating jobs anddelivering value to the UK economy. This means we must continue to develop UKstrengths in quantum computing hardware, software and throughout the supplychain, which involves meeting signiﬁcant engineering challenges.
Given the early stage of the technological development, and the fact that there arenumerous platforms that could provide the path to developing a fully scalablemachine, we will take a broad and ambitious approach to supporting quantumcomputing in the UK across the development of different hardware platforms,software, components, and all relevant supply chains. Although internationalcollaboration will be an important part of our approach, it is not in the UK’s intereststo sit back and rely purely on others for access to quantum computing hardware, sowe will continue to develop UK strengths across the development of differenthardware platforms, as well as software. We will monitor the development of thesetechnologies, both in the UK and in other countries, and the development of themarket to ensure that we can ﬂex our approach to deliver the best possibleoutcome for the UK.
For quantum sensing, timing and imaging, our ambition is to develop thetechnology so that the UK is in a strong position to play an important role globally inthe next generation of sensors and position, navigation and timing (PNT)capabilities, working with international partners.
For quantum communications, our ambition is to realise both the potential of thesetechnologies for secure communications where clear beneﬁts can bedemonstrated, as well as the opportunities they present for networking to help scalequantum computers, sharing information and addressing data storage challenges.Collaborating with international partners is a key element of this approach.
As quantum technologies develop and use cases are fully demonstrated, the UKwill need to make key strategic decisions about where to focus efforts to realise thebeneﬁts from these technologies. At this early stage it is important to continue tobuild the science, grow the vibrant ecosystem, explore a range of technologyplatforms and parts of the supply chain where the UK has world leading strengths,in addition to focussing on software and use case exploration. But it is alsoimportant to be more targeted where and when we can, working with industry toaccelerate development within high value applications as they emerge to grow aworld class quantum sector and deliver beneﬁts for the economy and society.
We will therefore develop government actions over time within the widerprogramme based on progress and wider trends, in full consultation with the UK

quantum community. We will report regularly to the National Science andTechnology Council, chaired by the Prime Minister, and publish an annual report onprogress.
This strategy sets out how we will put this approach into practice through domesticand international policy to achieve our vision and objectives for quantumtechnologies in the UK.
Ten-year vision and goals
Over the next ten years, we will build on our success to date by taking advantage ofour world leading science and capabilities and supporting the continued growth ofthe UK’s quantum sector to realise the signiﬁcant potential of quantum technologiesfor the economy.
Our ten-year vision is for the UK to be a world leading quantum-enabledeconomy, building on scientiﬁc excellence and creating a thriving quantumsector to ensure that quantum technologies are an integral part of the UK’sdigital infrastructure and advanced manufacturing base, driving growth andhelping to build a strong and resilient economy and society.
To realise this vision we will set four goals:
Ensure the UK is home to world-leading quantum science and engineering,growing UK knowledge and skillsSupport business, making the UK the go-to place for quantum businesses andan integral part of the global supply chain, as well as a preferred location forinvestors and global talentDrive the use of quantum technologies in the UK to deliver beneﬁts for theeconomy, for society and for our national securityCreate a national and international regulatory framework that supports innovationand the ethical use of quantum technologies, and protects UK capabilities andnational security
The government has published a Science and Technology Framework(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-science-and-technology-framework) tobuild the UK into a Science and Technology Superpower, to help deliver strongergrowth, better jobs, and bold discoveries to tackle the challenges of today andtomorrow. The Science and Technology Framework has been designed inconsultation with experts and practitioners across industry, academia andgovernment to address the key challenges in delivering the UK’s Science andTechnology Superpower ambitions. It represents commitment to a whole-of-government plan – introducing a truly systems approach to ensure policy, delivery,funding and messaging levers across traditional siloes are aligned and channelledto secure strategic advantage in S&T as a top UK priority. It includes boostinginvestment in research and development, building on the UK’s already enviabletalent and skills base, investing in research and innovation infrastructure, ensuringwe regulate in a way that supports innovation and growing technology sectors.

The Framework also sets out a more systematic way of identifying UK prioritytechnologies, with the ﬁrst ﬁve including quantum technologies (as well as AI,engineering biology, semiconductors, and future telecoms). As such, quantumtechnologies will beneﬁt from the wider use of government levers set out in theFramework. This National Quantum Strategy therefore focuses on the quantumspeciﬁc activities that the government or others need to undertake, in addition towider government initiatives, to support the growth of the sector.
The following chapters set out how we will achieve each of our four goals.
Goal 1: World-leading research and skills
We will ensure the UK is home to world-leading quantum science andengineering, growing UK knowledge and skills
Research and Development
The UK is the home to excellent science and innovation, and nowhere is this moretrue than in quantum technologies, where we already have an establishedprogramme of public and private R&D with over £1 billion of investment over theperiod 2014-2024.
The next phase of quantum R&D in the UK will be even greater in terms ofambition, scale and impact. It will focus on securing and building on our existingstrengths, as well as exploring new areas of scientiﬁc endeavour. It will providegreater support to the work of our researchers and businesses to translate,demonstrate and commercialise quantum research, driving development in keyareas with commercial, societal or security value. This will ensure that the UK is aglobal centre of excellence for the long term.
We will therefore establish a new and ambitious ten-year £2.5 billion quantumresearch and innovation programme from 2024-2034.
The future programme will be delivered in two 5-year phases, to be developed infull consultation with our partners across government, most notably UK Researchand Innovation (UKRI), independent expert advice and with industry. The coreelements of the ﬁrst 5-year phase will include:
A new portfolio of applications-focussed Quantum Technology Research Hubsand Centres. These will build on the success that the existing hubs have had inbuilding a vibrant quantum research and innovation ecosystem. The future hubswill draw together activities around a speciﬁc application area or theme,delivering strength and depth in quantum technologies and catalysing futuregrowth and national capability. They will ensure the UK is a global centre ofexcellence in cutting edge quantum science and technologies for the long term.These new Research Hubs or Centres will be formed from consortia of academicexperts in quantum technologies and relevant disciplines, with additional

National Quantum Strategy (accessible webpage) - GOV.UK
collaborating partners from industry, government, or the third sector. The hubswill also build the mechanisms needed to support the integration of theseemerging technologies into wider systems, led by end users.Mission-focussed programmes: speciﬁc outcome-focussed innovationprogrammes to drive development towards a set societal and economic beneﬁt.Industry-led innovation programmes: project-based programmes encouraginggreater R&D activity and further investment by industry in areas that addressexisting challenges to commercialisation. The programme might includefeasibility projects to explore new opportunities for the commercialisation ofquantum technologies; or collaborative innovation projects to tackle thechallenges to translating and commercialising quantum.Accelerator programmes: that will grow speciﬁc technology sectors andcompanies and accelerate the path to commercial and technological maturity,building on key strengths in the current programme and UK landscape andpromoting sovereign capability and market leadership in areas with signiﬁcantmarket opportunity. These programmes will focus on bridging the gap betweenearly growth and market readiness by enabling demonstration in real-worldsettings with users and integrators.Training and talent programmes: to invest in post-graduate skills, technical andengineering professionals, and apprenticeships to deliver the quantumresearchers, innovators, and practitioners the UK needs.International collaboration programmes: building on the strengths of the existingprogramme and broadening international R&D collaborations with our closepartners for mutual beneﬁt.Infrastructure investments: to meet the needs of the evolving ﬁeld and sector,including continued funding for core operational activities of national facilitiessuch as the National Quantum Computing Centre and National PhysicalLaboratory.Underpinning fundamental research: continuing to enable response moderesearch through existing EPSRC and STFC programmes to advance thescience, and enable the utilisation of quantum as a tool for wider research.
We recognise the need to make a smooth transition from the current R&Dprogramme to the new ten-year programme. The current phase of the programmewill continue to deliver world leading research through all existing core elementsuntil 2024. Over the next year we will consult widely on the speciﬁcs of the futureprogramme and will also make additional investments within the existingprogramme to support the transition. These additional investments include:
£100 million to continue to develop the existing application areas of computing,communications, sensing, imaging and timing through new quantum hubactivities£70 million in the development of two short-term quantum missions focussed onachieving key technological milestones around quantum computing and PNT.This approach over the next three years will act as a pilot for longer-termmissions that will be delivered over the next decade to galvanise technologydevelopment and help address some of society’s most pressing challenges.

£25 million for increased investment in quantum fellowships and doctoraltraining, over and above the existing Centres for Doctoral Training andFellowships schemes£15 million to boost government procurement of quantum technologies for publicuse£20 million for acceleration activities, working with the sector on collaborativeR&D in quantum networking£20 million additional funding for increased activities through the NationalQuantum Computing Centre
The £70 million quantum missions announced as part of thegovernment’s £250 million Technology Missions Fund aim to:
Accelerate quantum technologies for resilient capabilities in PositionNavigation & Timing (PNT), leading to the demonstration of mature proof-of-principle prototypes by 2025 in environments where traditional satellitescannot reach, creating resilience in military and civil contexts.Developing quantum computing test-beds – demonstrating the advantage ofa quantum computer over a classical one through applications to underpinthe growth of a UK quantum computing sector capable of delivering quantumadvantage in 2025.
For this investment of £2.5 billion we are expecting the private sector to commit toinvest £1 billion into the programme over its lifetime. Up to now, we have achievedevenly matched industry funding from our innovation programmes. This takesaccount of direct contributions to programme activities only; the overall beneﬁts andinvestment into the sector resulting from the programme will be much greater.
Skills
Access to the right skills and talent is essential for excellence in research,technology development and commercialisation. Building a diverse and thrivingworkforce that can drive the growing quantum industry will be vital to unlockingeconomic and societal beneﬁts in the future. This requires highly skilled people –ensuring the UK has the researchers, engineers, innovators, and practitioners itneeds to have a quantum-ready workforce. It means postgraduate training, thedevelopment of technical professionals and apprenticeships, and attraction andretention of world leading experts in the ﬁeld.
The quantum sector is small but rapidly evolving, with an expectation that skillsneeds will change over time. The call for evidence responses told us we are facingchallenges associated with the small global talent pool for quantum-speciﬁc talent.A recent survey found that the top challenge for businesses in preparing forquantum computing was being able to access the right skills and talent [footnote 22].Talent shortages also exist within the domestic sector itself according to UK-basedcompanies.

14/10/2023, 16:16
National Quantum Strategy (accessible webpage) - GOV.UK
The picture is similar internationally, with the US National Science and TechnologyCouncil ﬁnding that there is a skills shortage at all levels already, alongside aprojected increase in demand in the future [footnote 23]. Further to this, the widerSTEM workforce that acts as a pipeline for future talent has been found to sufferfrom some persistent skill shortages, and be less diverse than the wider workforce.Women make up just over a quarter of the STEM workforce [footnote 24], making itchallenging to achieve a diverse future workforce that is representative of society.
People and know-how are driving the early development of the emerging sector.We have provided strong support for growing the highly-specialised skills needed inthe quantum sector since 2014. We have trained more than 470 doctoral students[footnote 25], including through the EPSRC’s Centres for Doctoral Training(https://www.ukri.org/what-we-offer/developing-people-and-skills/epsrc/studentships/centres-for-doctoral-training/) (CDTs), the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory(https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-science-and-technology-laboratory)(Dstl) and the National Physical Laboratory (https://www.npl.co.uk/news/npl-and-nist-sign-mou). We have also funded over 30 fellowships to support the brightest and thebest to undertake their research in the UK, recognising the importance of academicfreedom to do great things [footnote 26].
Fellowships
Quantum fellowships have been instrumental in nurturing early talent, providingaccess to specialist support and equipment, and allowing individuals to growtheir international networks. The success of these awards can be seen throughthe world class research and spinouts that have resulted from current andformer fellows.
These include:
Joint EPSRC and NQCC scheme (https://www.ukri.org/news/securing-the-next-generation-of-quantum-technology-researchers/) to support fellows to build theircareers and deliver cutting-edge research in the UKThe EPSRC Open Fellowship (https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/epsrc-open-fellowship/) supporting talented researchers across EPSRC’s portfolioThe UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship (https://www.ukri.org/what-we-offer/developing-people-and-skills/future-leaders-fellowships/) designed to developthe next generation of world-class researchers across universities,businesses and other R&D environmentsSTFC Ernest Rutherford Fellowships (https://www.ukri.org/what-we-offer/developing-people-and-skills/stfc/fellowships/ernest-rutherford-fellowships/)enabling early career researchers to establish a research programme
The UK has beneﬁtted from attracting quantum talent from around the world. TheUK’s points-based immigration system provides attractive routes for highly skilledpeople to move to the UK, including the high potential individual visa, scale-up visa,innovator visa, and the global talent visa. However, the visa system can sometimesact as a barrier to attracting highly talented individuals. We will work with partners

across government to ensure that the immigration system allows companies anduniversities to attract the very top talent, who are in high demand in multiplecountries.
Visa routes
The government is updating the routes that talented individuals in the ﬁeld ofquantum can use to come to the UK and continue their careers. We will ensurethat the quantum sector is able to make full use of this opportunity. Announcedin the UK Innovation Strategy (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-innovation-strategy-leading-the-future-by-creating-it), these include:
the High Potential Individual Route (https://www.gov.uk/high-potential-individual-visa) make it as simple as possible for internationally mobile researchers whodemonstrate high potential to come to the UK, based on graduation from aneligible top global university;a scale-up route (https://www.gov.uk/scale-up-worker-visa), which allows talentedindividuals with an offer from a qualifying scale-up to come to the UK;and a revitalised Innovator route (https://www.gov.uk/innovator-visa), whichallows talented innovators and entrepreneurs to start and run a business inthe UK that is either venture backed or innovative. This route is beingrefreshed to simplify and streamline its business eligibility criteria and buildﬂexibility
The Global Talent visa (https://www.gov.uk/global-talent) route is open to thosewho are leaders or potential leaders in science and technology. Applicants mustbe endorsed by one of six endorsing bodies for the route, which include TheRoyal Society and UKRI, or have been awarded a prestigious prize. Applicantsmay qualify for endorsement if they have an eligible job offer, an individualfellowship or a research grant approved by UKRI.
Building a quantum-literate workforceAs the sector scales, there will be a need for more emphasis on routes into thesector beyond doctoral training, as well as to build the pipeline from schoolsupwards. Professionalisation of quantum engineering skills will help talent totransition from adjacent sectors. To this end we will engage with UK professionalbodies including the Institution of Engineering & Technology (https://www.theiet.org/)(IET) and the Institute of Physics (https://www.iop.org/#gref) (IoP) to developawareness, skills and recognition of continuing professional development andcareers in support of the quantum sector. Increasing quantum literacy and cross-fertilisation with domain expertise in the economy overall, particularly in key end-user sectors, is essential to growing the sector in the UK.
We recognise the need for more skilled technicians in the UK, a problem that is notunique to the quantum sector. These are the people who undertake skilled practicalwork with scientiﬁc or other equipment to enable the integration of quantumtechnologies into wider systems, often undertaking vocational or on the job training.

National Quantum Strategy (accessible webpage) - GOV.UK
The IoP found that over 50% of physics-related jobs do not require a degree[footnote 27], indicating the potential scale of the role of vocational training. There arealready successful initiatives to meet the technician need, such as the NPLApprenticeship scheme (https://www.npl.co.uk/apprenticeships) which has hosted over100 apprentices since 2013, including rotations in the quantum technologydepartment. We will broaden activities to meet this growing need nationwide,aligning with wider government objectives to strengthen technical training in theUK.
The UK Science and Technology Framework(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-science-and-technology-framework/the-uk-science-and-technology-framework) will be seeking to address the broader STEM skillsgap through a dedicated Talent and Skills strand(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-science-and-technology-framework/the-uk-science-and-technology-framework#talent-and-skills). This will focus on creating an agileand responsive skills system; recruiting and retaining STEM teachers; expandingopportunities for participation in STEM and ensuring that a more diverse range ofpeople participate in STEM opportunities; giving people the opportunity to train,retrain and upskill throughout their lives; and establishing competitive advantage inattracting international talent to the UK. The Department for Education isdeveloping a Skills Dashboard in 2023 to better understand the supply and demandof science and technology skills for priority technologies, including quantumtechnologies.
To boost quantum skills in the UK we will:
More than double the number of Centres for Doctoral Training focused onQuantum Technologies. This will contribute to training over 1,000 PhD studentsin quantum or a directly supporting ﬁeld over the next ten years.Ensure the UK can continue to attract, develop and retain world leading expertsby investing in tailored packages, such as fellowships for the brightestresearchers.We will start with an investment of £25 million over the next two years to increasequantum-related fellowships and doctoral training. We will continue to increasethis over the new ten-year programme.Establish the Quantum Skills Taskforce, bringing together industry, academia,and professional societies with the relevant government agencies to ensure thatthe quantum skills system is guided by the needs of our most promisingcompanies. We will work further with these groups to develop and publish a skillsaction plan within the next 12 months.Develop a range of measures to inspire the next generation of quantumscientists, engineers, and technicians. We will fund an expansion of STEMLearning’s Quantum Ambassador schools outreach programme(https://www.stem.org.uk/stem-ambassadors/quantum-ambassadors), launch a furtherseries of domestic and international summer schools and research exchanges,and develop both a quantum industry placement scheme and a quantumapprenticeships programme.

Support global quantum talent moving to the UK through the enhanced visaroutes for highly-skilled individuals.Deliver a quantum priority stream in the UK Global Talent Network. The network,operating in the United States and India, will proactively attract and support thebest internationally mobile science and technology talent to come to the UK. Itwill work hand in hand with the National Quantum Technologies Programme,which will continue to provide access to funding, equipment, infrastructure, andnetworks to encourage world leading quantum talent to base research andcommercial activities in the UK.
International Partnerships
Quantum science and technologies are a global effort. We want to work with alliesand partners to achieve mutually beneﬁcial outcomes, whilst ensuring that the UKplays a leading role. We already take an open and collaborative approach to ourquantum research, with recent international network calls run by EPSRC aloneresulting in UK universities partnering with organisations in 28 countries [footnote 28].The Quantum Technologies for Fundamental Physics (QTFP) programme, whichstarted in 2020, has generated twenty-six unique international links from its sevenlarge consortia across 9 countries [footnote 29].
Our aims for international engagement are to:
Collaborate and share expertise with international partners on the opportunities,challenges and key uses of quantum, especially where technologies could helpto achieve major societal goals (as set out in the Quantum Tech for SocietalGood section).Drive progress in quantum R&D by deepening collaboration with internationalpartners, including those in Europe, and continuing to participate in leadingmultilateral research partnerships globally.Lead the global deﬁnition of the risks and opportunities of quantum, and workwith international partners to develop shared principles for the responsible andsecure development and deployment of quantum.
We are building collaborative relationships with a number of countries, such asunder the Joint Statement of Intent with the US(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-us-joint-statement-on-cooperation-in-quantum-information-sciences-and-technologies), which support mutually beneﬁcialgrowth in our sectors. These will boost both research collaboration and connectionsbetween our industries. These relationships will also grow links between centres ofexcellence; running exchanges, workshops, and summer schools to supportknowledge exchange; supporting intellectual property (IP) literacy; exploringmissions or ‘grand challenges’ with leading countries around speciﬁc scientiﬁcbreakthroughs or societal outcomes; and sharing access to key UK andinternational facilities.
We continue to engage informally with other leading nations on quantum, tosupport open collaboration and a pro-innovation regulatory approach, which will

help to grow quantum sectors and supply chains. This allows us to exchangeinformation on our national quantum programmes, opportunities and challengesand identify areas for future collaboration. We also work with a broad range ofcountries through multilateral fora, such as the OECD and the Global TechnologyForum, the World Economic Forum, the G7, and NATO, and take advantage ofbroader collaborative R&D opportunities born out of defence pacts such as AUKUS.
International conversations on technical standards are at an early stage withinstandards development organisations such as the Institute of Electrical andElectronics Engineers Standards Association, International Organization forStandardization and International Electrotechnical Commission. We will workclosely with industry, academia, civil society and with international partners toensure UK interests are represented at key standards and wider internationalbodies.
To step up our international work on quantum we will:
Expand our partnerships through a comprehensive programme of bilateralarrangements with leading quantum nations, working with the UK’s globalScience and Innovation Network (https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/uk-science-and-innovation-network), and considering the priorities and outcomes set in theforthcoming UK International Tech Strategy.Engage with other leading quantum nations to exchange knowledge on quantumprogrammes, developments, regulation and security.Increase our global networks through open calls on collaborative research.Provide additional funding for international collaboration through the newInternational Science Partnerships FundTake a leading role in multilateral fora to support UK quantum growth, forexample through the OECD and the recently announced Global TechnologyForum, the World Economic Forum, the G7, and NATO and look for broadercollaborative R&D opportunities born out of defence pacts such as AUKUSDemonstrate UK leadership in international standards fora, optimising theconditions for UK companies and creating standards that are compatible with ournorms and values.
In November 2021 we signed a Joint Statement of Intent with the US(https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-joint-statement-between-uk-and-us-to-strengthen-quantum-collaboration) to deepen collaboration on basic research,standards development and industry cooperation.
NPL and NIST (https://www.npl.co.uk/news/npl-and-nist-sign-mou) have agreed aformal collaborate on both R&D and standards development around quantumtechnologies. This collaboration act as a nucleus, growing to include other USlaboratories and international partners.
Joint research exchanges between UK and US partners will also be supportedby NPL and EPSRC, beginning with summer schools(https://www.ukri.org/news/uk-quantum-summer-schools-launched-will-build-

Goal 2: Supporting Business
Support business, making the UK the go-to place for quantum businesses andan integral part of the global supply chain, as well as a preferred location forinvestors and global talent.
The UK quantum sector
The UK has a thriving quantum ecosystem which provides huge opportunities totranslate ideas into economic value and societal impact. There are already at least160 companies active in the UK’s quantum sector[footnote 30], and our quantumcompanies have attracted more disclosed private equity investment than any otherEuropean country, second only to the US globally[footnote 31]. The UK quantumecosystem is comprised primarily of SMEs which operate in speciﬁc areas ofexpertise. This means collaboration is an essential part of the UK ecosystem -within the sector as well as with academia, allied sectors and user communities -and needs to be a fundamental part of our strategy going forwards.
UK start-up Quantum Motion raises £42 million to scale activities
In February 2023, London based start-up Quantum Motion raised over £42million in equity funding from some of the world’s leading quantum investors(Quantum Insider (https://thequantuminsider.com/2023/02/21/quantum-motion-raises-42-million-investment-in-latest-funding-round/)). Quantum Motion are developingscalable quantum computers using existing silicon manufacturing processes.The funding round was led by Robert Bosch Venture Capital and supported byBritish Patient Capital, among other investors. The increasing frequency oflarger UK investment rounds reﬂects progress technology development and anincreasing awareness and conﬁdence in the potential of quantum technologies.
We will ensure that the UK’s start-ups and SMEs can thrive in the UK. The growthof the sector is reliant on a steady ﬂow of newcomers into the ecosystem and theability of SMEs to grow their quantum business quickly and accelerate thedevelopment of their technology. The UK’s start-ups also require continued supportto manage the challenging “valley of death” stage of commercialisation, whereproducts are still in the development cycle and the company is not yet makingrevenue. Success is dependent on a critical mass of companies as well as theability of people, knowledge, and ideas to ﬂow in and out of this ecosystem fromsurrounding industries, users, and academia. Enabling all of this to happen will becritical to securing the UK’s position as a global quantum innovation hub.

National Quantum Strategy (accessible webpage) - GOV.UK
Working hand in hand with the quantum sector
Growing the quantum sector in the UK will be a truly collaborative endeavour overthe next ten years and beyond as the sector takes shape, with sufﬁcient time,resource and effort dedicated to the task. We will work closely with quantumcompanies as well as key industry and professional bodies such as UKQuantum,the Institute of Physics, the Royal Academy of Engineering, the Institute ofEngineering and Technology and techUK to make sure that industry views areunderstood and that government actions support growth. This engagement willcover areas such as the detailed design of the future R&D programme, skills,quantum readiness across the wider economy, international engagement, and theco-design of future regulation and standards.
Commercialisation and Accelerators
As outlined in the previous section, missions for quantum computing and PNT willinclude enabling activities to support commercialisation and user adoption in thesetechnology areas. In addition, we will develop new acceleration programmes forquantum technologies that will support the sector to capitalise on marketopportunities and build strategic advantage for the UK.
Acceleration programmes will help to speed commercialisation, industrialisation,and linking the sector to end-users by focussing on systems integration,applications, and real-world demonstrations. They will build on, and expand,existing activities being delivered by the NQTP partners and enable greaterparticipation from the growing UK sector. The speciﬁc investments and activities ofan accelerator programme will be tailored to the technology areas and will includeefforts to roadmap the route to market for key applications. We will continue toengage the community to help shape these programmes.
We will also continue industry-led innovation funding opportunities, such as thatprovided via the ISCF quantum challenge. This will help de-risk investments overthe medium to long-term and encourage new entrants to join the sector. The ISCFhas an impressive track record of helping companies to secure investmentalongside grant agreements, as well as helping to grow the pipeline of new start-ups through feasibility studies.
Infrastructure
The UK’s quantum facilities and centres of excellence are spread across all regionsof the country. We have made signiﬁcant investments in government-ownedinfrastructure to support industry and the development of new products based onquantum technologies. This includes expanding the facilities and capabilities at theNational Physical Laboratory in Teddington and establishing the National QuantumComputing Centre at the Harwell Campus in Oxfordshire. This is in addition to thenetwork of research and innovation infrastructure built up in the existing QuantumTechnology Research Hubs, and investment in wider capabilities such as theNational Dark Fibre Facility (https://www.ndff.ac.uk/) and computing capabilities in

The region is marked by the emergence and growth of innovative start-ups,leading manufacturers (such as Coherent Scotland and M Squared), and largedefence systems integrators with strong laser and radar divisions. This iscombined with a world-class research base, with several universities havingextensive legacies in lasers and photonics as well as in quantum optics andcold atom work.
The cluster is also supported by other leading research & development andinnovation centres such as the James Watt Nanofabrication Centre(https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/jwnc/) based at the University of Glasgow, andthe Li-Fi Centre (https://www.liﬁ-centre.com/) at the University of Strathclyde.
Helping to tie the ecosystem together is the Fraunhofer Centre for AppliedPhotonics UK (https://www.cap.fraunhofer.co.uk/), a world-leading centre in appliedlaser research and development, based at the University of Strathclyde.
The network of institutions in the Central Belt is closely tied to the NQTP,notably through the Quantum Imaging Hub (https://www.quantic.ac.uk/aboutus/)(QuantIC) led by the University of Glasgow (partnered in Scotland with theUniversities of Edinburgh, Heriot-Watt and Strathclyde), but with the other threeof the UK’s quantum technology hubs also having a strong presence inuniversity physics departments in Scotland. Almost half of all government-supported Commercialising Quantum Technologies Programme projectsinvolve a Scottish organisation participant (UK Quantum TechnologiesChallenge, The Directory, UKRI) (https://technologyscotland.scot/celebrating-day-of-photonics/).

Leading-edge university researchers have been brought together with high-techcompanies focused on delivering market-ready products with critical applicationin quantum technologies.
This activity has been underpinned by the UKRI Strength in Places Fund(https://www.ukri.org/what-we-offer/browse-our-areas-of-investment-and-support/strength-in-places-fund/) through the establishment of centres ofexcellence, such as the Institute for Compound Semiconductors(https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/institute-compound-semiconductors) and a Future CSManufacturing Hub (https://compoundsemiconductorhub.org/about-us/), both locatedat Cardiff University, and the Centre for Integrated Semiconductor Materials atSwansea University. Exploitation across the supply chain is facilitated byresearch translation entities such as The CS Centre(https://www.compoundsemiconductorcentre.com/) and The CS ApplicationsCatapult (https://csa.catapult.org.uk/).
The industrial activity is driven by the presence of expanding global leaders:IQE, the market leader in supply of advanced compound semiconductormaterials; KLA, a leader in semiconductor manufacturing, inspection andmetrology tools, and Microchip Technology, a leading provider of mixed-signaland analogue semiconductor products.
The NQTP seeks to build on this regional excellence. To date the cluster hasbeen a UK manufacturing source for novel quantum components, and is thecoordinator of the UK National Quantum Foundry(https://csconnected.com/projects/projects/qfoundry/).
The next ten years of innovation will require access to the right research andinnovation infrastructure to test, pilot and demonstrate the value of thesetechnologies in the laboratory and real-world settings so that we can acceleratetheir path to market.
The government has a role to play in providing critical infrastructure where accessto equipment or facilities provides shared beneﬁts. This includes, for example,facilities for testing and evaluation of technologies, which in turn builds conﬁdencein system integrators, end-users, investors, and the manufacturers themselves. Italso includes large national scale infrastructure for demonstrating the value oftechnologies in real world settings. This might include the development of futurequantum networks with the ability to distribute quantum information and quantum-based references such as timing signals around the country between key locations.The commercialisation of quantum technologies, as well as other inter-relatedtechnologies such as semiconductors, is also likely to require fabrication facilities,and we will look at the different options for providing additional support in this area.
To support the UK quantum sector, we will
Launch missions for Quantum Computing and PNT that will include enablingactivities to support commercialisation and user adoption in these technologyareas (as outlined in the previous section)

Develop new acceleration programmes for quantum technologies that willsupport the sector in capitalising on market opportunities. Accelerationprogrammes will help to speed commercialisation, industrialisation, and linkingthe sector to end-users by focussing on systems integration, roadmapping,applications, and real-world demonstrations. We will start with an additional £20million over the next two years to fund an accelerator for quantum networking, acollaborative programme with industry.Launch a new round of industry-led innovation funding opportunities under thenew ten-year programmeWork with industry to undertake feasibility studies on key infrastructure andprogramme requirements to enable the future beneﬁts associated with quantumtechnologies to be better understood and realised, starting with quantumcommunications.Commission the Royal Academy of Engineering to undertake an independentinfrastructure review by the end of 2023 to map the UK’s quantum infrastructureand the sector’s infrastructure requirements for the next decade against those ofother key UK sectors (such as semiconductors, photonics or space), including forfabrication facilities. This will help to identify where there is a rationale forgovernment to invest for the future, or where the UK should seek to partner withother nations to enable access to critical infrastructure.Open-up access to the facilities of participating partners across industry,research organisations, universities, and government-owned facilities for testing,problem-solving, and performance demonstration.Produce a directory of existing infrastructure accessible to industry across theUK and explore the quantum industry’s requirements for additional infrastructureover the next decade.Work through the NQCC to negotiate access to quantum computing resourcesacross a range of platforms for wider research and the quantum industry,providing a front door for those businesses looking to engage with the quantumcommunity and explore use cases. We will provide an additional £20 million overthe next two years to boost the work of the NQCC.

The UK’s business support offer
The UK is well known for being a great place to start and grow a business, withconsiderable support available to companies. This includes:
The development of a central government Innovation Hub to help to make sureall business support is available in one convenient place. There are a range ofexisting support mechanisms available to UK businesses to help them overcomethe challenges of starting and scaling their business such as the Innovate UK:EDGE (https://www.innovateukedge.ukri.org/) programmes, ICURe(https://www.setsquared.co.uk/programme/icure-programme-2/), and QUEST(https://www.qtecbristol.com/quest).Digital guidance and tools from the Intellectual Property Ofﬁce (IPO) to helpbusinesses understand the IP system and take informed decisions on how toprotect and commercialise their IP. The IPO also works in partnership to providegrant funding for innovative, high-growth potential businesses towards costs ofprofessional advice and support for UK businesses to protect and manage theirIP overseas through the International IP Service.Testing and evaluation services through the National Physical Laboratory(https://www.npl.co.uk/quantum-programme/capabilities?viewmode=0) (NPL) through ameasurement scheme which provides up to 20 days of specialist quantummeasurement expertise to solve business’s measurement challenges at nocharge. NPL are helping companies to bridge the gap from a technologyprototype in a research environment to industry-ready, innovative new products.Advice and support to companies from the National Protective Security Agency(NPSA) (https://www.npsa.gov.uk/) (CPNI) and the National Cyber Security Centre(https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/) (NCSC) to help them to put in place protective digital andphysical security measures to ensure the protection of assets which arenecessary to support growth.Support to businesses to help them export and grow into global markets from theDepartment for Business and Trade (DBT).

Investment to unleash innovation
To develop a globally competitive quantum technologies sector we must ensure UKcompanies can access ﬁnance at all stages of growth. Quantum technologies canrequire large amounts of investment before they produce a return and have lengthyresearch and development cycles to reach the market, requiring more patientcapital than some other technology sectors. Later funding rounds will be key toenable companies to scale-up and expand their manufacturing capabilities astechnologies reach the market. This challenge is particularly important for quantumcomputing companies due to the large capital requirements for developing andscaling hardware.
The UK is a great place for businesses to access the funding they need forinnovation. During 2022, fast-growing UK tech companies continued to raise atnear-record levels (£24 billion), more than France (£11.8 billion) and Germany(£9.1 billion) combined. This takes the total raised over the past ﬁve years to nearly£100 billion (£97 billion)[footnote 33].
The government remains committed to its long-term objective to mobilising moreinstitutional investment into productive areas of the economy, ensuring that saversstand to beneﬁt from the growth of the UK’s most innovative companies.  We aretaking action to deliver this objective and meet the 2019 manifesto commitment to‘unlock long-term capital in pension funds to invest in and commercialise ourscientiﬁc discoveries, creating a vibrant science-based economy post-Brexit’.  Thegovernment is legislating to implement important regulatory changes such asreform of the pensions regulatory charge cap, which will provide clarity for industryand ensure pension savers stand to beneﬁt from higher potential investmentreturns. We continue to engage closely with industry stakeholders to develop themost effective policies to support this objective.
Government ﬁnance mechanisms
The British Business Bank (https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/national-security-strategic-investment-fund/) is an important delivery partner in our efforts to makeﬁnance markets for smaller businesses work more effectively, allowing thosebusinesses to prosper, grow and build UK economic activity. Up to the end of2020, the Bank had supported the provision of £42 billion worth of ﬁnance to170,000 small and medium-sized businesses across the UK, not including itsCOVID-19 debt and equity ﬁnance schemes (UK Innovation Strategy)(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-innovation-strategy-leading-the-future-by-creating-it/uk-innovation-strategy-leading-the-future-by-creating-it-accessible-webpage)
The Bank provides access to scaling capital at larger, later-stage fundingrounds, through British Patient Capital (https://www.britishpatientcapital.co.uk/)(BPC) which, since its launch in 2018, has become the largest domesticinvestor in UK venture and venture growth funds (BPC(https://www.britishpatientcapital.co.uk/about/)). Its long-term investment approachhelps UK companies access the right type of funding at the right time in their

life cycle and is intended to demonstrate that a patient investment approach –which can support deeptech companies – can produce commercially attractivereturns.
The British Business Bank has also launched Future Fund: Breakthrough(https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/future-fund-breakthrough/), a£375 million UK-wide programme that will co-invest alongside private investorsdirectly in later funding rounds at high-growth, innovative ﬁrms. The programmewill focus on R&D intensive companies and will aim to accelerate thedeployment of breakthrough technologies which can transform major industries,develop new medicines, and support the UK transition to a net zero economy.
Technology is a focus area for the Future Fund: Breakthrough programme, withBPC seeing quantum computing as a future technology which has the potentialto revolutionise a multitude of sectors, cementing the UK’s position at theforefront of global innovation. BPC have invested in Oxford Quantum Circuits’£38 million Series A funding round through its Future Fund: Breakthroughprogramme (BPC (https://www.britishpatientcapital.co.uk/press-release/british-patient-capital-contributes-6-7-million-to-oxford-quantum-circuits-38-million-series-a-funding-round/)).
The National Security Strategic Investment Fund (NSSIF) is the government’scorporate venture capital arm for dual-use advanced technologies. NSSIFinvests commercially in advanced technology ﬁrms, alongside other investors,to support long-term equity investment. Because they co-invest, every poundthey invest is leveraged by private investment. NSSIF’s quantum strategy aimsto support a thriving UK ecosystem and deliver early quantum advantage fornational security and defence. Through British Technology Investments Limited,which acts as NSSIF’s direct investment arm, NSSIF has made directinvestments in quantum technology companies. In addition, it has broadexposure to a range of other quantum ﬁrms via its indirect ‘fund-of-funds’investments.
Growing global supply chains
The supply chain that underpins the quantum sector – whilst still nascent – isalready truly global. Based on a survey of 54 relevant UK companies, 85% areimporting elements of their supply chain to develop quantum technologies[footnote33]. UK companies are a key part of this global supply chain.
We have industrial strengths and leading companies across the supply chain, inareas such as photonics, electronics and cryogenics, which are essential toquantum technologies. We have world leading clusters, such as the compoundsemiconductor cluster in South Wales, and a long-established photonics cluster inScotland.
To promote our companies in domestic and global supply chains and to boostinvestment, we will:

Work with key organisations such as UKQuantum (https://ukquantum.org/) andtechUK (https://www.techuk.org/) and the Department for Business and Trade todevelop promotional material targeted at critical user sectors for disseminationnationally and internationally, as well as to deliver a targeted global opportunitiescampaign, working with global partners to promote the UK sector overseas, buildtrade opportunities and open-up investment and collaboration opportunities forUK companies.Work with international partners to consider future security of supply andfacilitate the growth of a trusted supply chain for the sector, beneﬁting the growthof the UK ecosystem as well as those of our partner nations.
Attracting quantum businesses to the UK
Much of the UK quantum business sector is formed from homegrown talent,nurtured through our universities and quantum hubs or established in larger UKcompanies. There is also an important place for quantum companies from overseasin the UK ecosystem. The UK is already an attractive location due to our strengthsin quantum science, our supply chain, our wider business-friendly environment, oursupport for innovation and our talented quantum skills base. For example, therecent return of quantum computing ﬁrm PsiQuantum to the UK, with theestablishment of a quantum computing research centre in Daresbury in the North-West of England, demonstrated conﬁdence in the competitiveness of the UK’squantum sector. In 2021, IBM worked with the government to establish the HartreeNational Centre for Digital Innovation, which brings together world-leading expertisein AI and quantum computing to support their application in industry and the publicsector.
We will:
Build programmes and investment opportunities that attract quantum companiesfrom overseas. We will proactively support quantum businesses that want tocome to the UK, working with the Department for Business and Trade(https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-and-trade).
Goal 3: Driving the adoption of QuantumTechnologies in the UK
Drive the adoption of quantum technologies in the UK to deliver beneﬁts for theeconomy, society and for national security
If the UK is to reap their full beneﬁts, all sectors of the economy must understandthe opportunities from quantum technologies. Industry, researchers, and the publicsector will need to understand and explore how they can utilise quantumtechnologies to do things differently, or even doing things that currently aren’tpossible. This is challenging in an emerging sector where it is not always clearexactly how or when quantum technologies will offer a competitive advantage.

A recent EY report found that only 25-33% of businesses had taken concrete stepsto prepare for the arrival of quantum computing, despite 48% believing quantumcomputing will play an important role in their industries by 2025[footnote 34].
We will raise awareness of the opportunities and foster the right connections tobuild an understanding of user needs. We will set direction and providing a signal ofintent by focussing efforts on where quantum will deliver the most value for the UK.Below we have set out some of these areas of opportunity that relate to net zero,national security, health, digital innovation and critical growth sectors – particularlythose relating to the other four technologies of tomorrow (AI, future telecoms,semiconductors and engineering biology).
In previous chapters we have set out our missions-based approach which willgalvanise research and innovation activities towards a deﬁned societal beneﬁt. Thetwo tech missions in PNT and computing will be important testing ground for moreambitious future missions, which will include a focus on those applications that willhave the greatest impact to drive early adoption in key sectors, such as ﬁnancialservices and life sciences. Developing testbeds for different hardware platforms is afocus of the current computing mission and we will look to expand these efforts asthe technology develops.
Bridging the gap between nascent technology development and end userapplications will be an important role for the NQCC, with the potential for ambitiousmissions to drive largescale testing across selected sectors. This work will besupported by expanded government procurement activities, such as the CatalystFund set out later in this chapter, which will concentrate on pairing the capabilitiesof quantum with the government’s biggest challenges.
Quantum Technologies for Societal Good
Quantum technologies will offer a step-change in performance across a wide rangeof applications and are enablers to wider innovation across the economy, with £100billions of expected beneﬁts estimated globally in the coming decades[footnote 35].Future applications of quantum technologies include:
An environmentally sustainable and resilient UK: By mimicking nature aquantum computer could simulate new materials, accelerate improvements in solarpanels and batteries, and help improve the efﬁciency of renewable energy sources.By modelling and optimizing logistics and trafﬁc network ﬂows, quantum computingcould reduce carbon emissions as well as bring about signiﬁcant efﬁciency savings.Meanwhile, by monitoring the emission of greenhouse gases, quantum sensorscould help the UK to meet emissions targets and monitor compliance.
Strengthened security, defence and resilience at home and overseas: Bysolving complex optimisation problems, and sending information in a quantum statewe could improve sensor networks for defence purposes and enable autonomythrough enhanced sensors. We could use quantum-enhanced machine learning forpattern matching, image and voice recognition and classiﬁcation, and data fusion.The use of quantum computing and sensing on the battleﬁeld could enable us to

ﬁnd targets of interest and enhance situational awareness. Quantum computerscould solve complex calculations for modelling and improving performance on thebattleﬁeld. Short and long-range quantum communication systems may providehigh bandwidth, secure point-to-point communications which cannot be interceptedand can be covert on deployable platforms. Quantum sensing, timing and imagingcapabilities could provide the next generation of PNT capabilities to support troopson deployment, including in built-up urban environments where access to currentsystems is challenging.
The UK as a world leader in health and life sciences: By solving complexlogistical problems, quantum computing could help make hospital systems moreefﬁcient, improving delivery and reducing costs. Quantum computing could alsoanalyse vast and unstructured data sets to speed up new drug developmenttimelines and reduce costs. Better, cheaper or easier imaging will enable improveddiagnostics and outcomes for patients, for example, for use during cancer surgeryto remove damaged tissue, or to monitor epilepsy in children, or brain damage andconcussion.
The UK as a meaningful digital actor and unlocking the power of data for theUK: By accelerating optimization routines, quantum computing could enhancescenario planning, logistics and risk management within ﬁnancial systems.Quantum computers may accelerate machine learning and provide reinforcementlearning using unbiased data sets. Quantum technologies could act as an enablerfor the further development of smart cities through sensing, networking andcompute capabilities.
Supporting other UK priority technologies and sectors
As enabling technologies, quantum products and services will often unlockinnovation through integration of a wider suite of technological solutions. Given thebreadth of anticipated capabilities and advances in performance, they will also haveapplications across many sectors. This represents both a great opportunity and achallenge for commercialisation. Considerable work is required to understand thedrivers and technological challenges within critical sectors of the economy. Thisincludes future telecoms networks, the space, defence, health, AI, highperformance computing, photonics and semiconductor industries. We must ensurethat efforts to roadmap and support technological advances within other sectors aremindful of what quantum could offer and develop an integrated whole systemapproach, enabling suitable environments within which to test and demonstrateapplications. Substantial work will also be required to integrate new quantumtechnologies into existing systems of classical technologies and to assure theircapabilities.
Quantum computing, high performance computing, AI and cloudcomputing: the case for convergence
As quantum computing develops, we will need to take every advantage ofsynergies between capabilities and opportunities in other technologies. As setout in the independent review of the Future of Compute

(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/future-of-compute-review), highperformance computing is required in the UK to accelerate and steer thedevelopment of frontier AI in a manner aligned with the UK’s values andobjectives. Over the next ten years, quantum computing will be an importantaddition to the UK’s high performance computing ecosystem, where integratedhybrid solutions are likely to be critical to achieving the best results. Meanwhile,cloud access and orchestration of resources has the potential to makecompute, including quantum computing, more accessible to a broad range ofusers.
The NQCC is already supporting convergence through exploring quantummachine learning applications and identifying mechanisms for cloud access toquantum computing for UK industry and researchers. Work will also beundertaken to further understanding of the quantum sector’s needs foradvanced computing capabilities and how we can meet the integrationchallenges.
Given the early stage of technology development for quantum computing,awareness raising and upskilling users to explore potential use cases ischallenging. But the requirement to engage early is critical. The NQCC will play acrucial role in raising awareness and improving readiness, as well as providing testbeds and access to compute to enable use case exploration.
NQCC test bed for quantum computing applications
The NQCC has developed an extensive programme of support for users under theSparQ Applications Discovery Programme (https://www.nqcc.ac.uk/engage-with-us/), tohelp them understand the opportunities associated with quantum computing,including training programmes and hackathons. The programme is ensuringresources are in place to provide access to state-of-the-art quantum computeresources delivered via the cloud, applications expertise, sharing of best practiseand technical support to help shape and drive industry adoption.
Furthermore, the NQCC will ensure test beds are developed and supported toenable the UK quantum computing developer community. These will be a mix ofhosted hardware for end user access, state-of-the-art cloud services and wellcharacterised stable platforms with full stack access to support developers inunderstanding error causality, mitigation and correction on the road towards large-scale fault tolerant machines of the future. The NQCC along with the QuantumSoftware Laboratory at the University of Edinburgh will investigate emerging usecases with societal impact. The NQCC will also examine key challenges aroundscaling quantum computing machines; veriﬁcation, benchmarking, and errorcorrection.
SparQ Applications Discovery Programme
The SparQ programme, developed by the National Quantum Computing Centre(NQCC), will help UK-based companies and researchers in the earlyexploration of applications for quantum computing. The NQCC is teaming up

with Oxford Quantum Circuits (OQC) amongst others, to provide businessesand researchers with access to quantum compute resources includingemulators, simulators, annealers and gate-based quantum computingplatforms.
While many government and research institutions around the world havedeveloped programs aimed at raising awareness about quantum, SparQ goesfurther to take industry and government users through a journey fromawareness, to engagement, evaluation, action and advocacy supported throughfour key elements: access to quantum computers, technical support andapplications expertise, workshops and networking opportunities and learningresources. These elements are all aimed at allowing potential users to gainearly hands-on experience in working with quantum hardware and algorithms toaddress challenges that are relevant to industry. Critically, the program is notjust for quantum computer scientists and researchers, but also industry endusers – people who are most likely to take quantum know-how and turn it intoreal world applications.
Leading by example through government signalling andprocurement
There are many areas where quantum technologies could improve public servicedelivery and enhance government’s capabilities – from improving the way wemonitor climate change from space, to providing the ability to sense undergroundobjects to speed up major infrastructure projects.
Government can act as an early adopter of emerging technologies to supporttechnology development and demonstrate the value of technologies to othersectors of the economy. There are numerous examples where procurement hasbeen used to drive innovation such as through the Small Business ResearchInitiative (https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/sbri-the-small-business-research-initiative) (SBRI) and the National Security Strategic Investment Fund(https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/national-security-strategic-investment-fund/)(NSSIF), providing public service improvements for the government whilstsupporting small businesses and stimulating markets. As part of NSSIF’s strategy,and to deliver insight and access to quantum computing for government, NSSIFhas deployed £2.6 million in R&D contracts with quantum companies, helping tostimulate growth in the UK quantum ecosystem.
Defence is a key area where the government acts as an early adopter of emergingtechnologies. The MOD was a key partner in setting up the NQTP in 2014. MODhas identiﬁed key quantum technology applications for defence, including sensing,imaging, and timing, as well as subsequent near-term opportunities incommunications and computing. MOD has shared its own novel S&T with theNQTP, while in turn drawing on the expertise within the programme. This hasallowed the department to assess future challenges, understand applications androutes to exploitation, and ensure Defence is ‘quantum ready’.

National Quantum Strategy (accessible webpage) - GOV.UK
The MOD Science & Technology Strategy(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mod-science-and-technology-strategy-2020)also outlines the government’s intention to be an understanding ﬁrst customer, anearly adopter of innovation and a customer that’s prepared to take some risk –taking relatively immature technologies and experimenting with them withinDefence systems. MOD will send clear messages to quantum innovators andpotential collaborators on the military challenges identiﬁed which may be addressedby quantum technologies, while also welcoming and encouraging novel ideas andopportunities that Defence may not have yet identiﬁed. Government will workacross departments to explore other key public sector applications and considerhow other departments can learn from this example.
To drive the adoption of quantum technologies, we will:
Raise awareness of the opportunities associated with their use through sectorspeciﬁc engagement and showcasing, as well as demonstration activitiesthrough the R&D programme.Accelerate the recently launched NQCC SparQ Applications Discoveryprogramme, with speciﬁc workstreams dedicated to use case exploration,testing, and upskilling within the public, defence, aerospace, and healthcaresectors. This builds on existing work with the ﬁnance sector to understand keydrivers and opportunities, with further work planned to ensure the sector isresilient to the threats to encryption from future scalable machines.Expand the NQCC’s ability to act as a ﬁrst customer on government’s behalf byprocuring prototype platforms and access to compute to accelerate the growth ofthe sector and enable sectors and government users to explore use cases.Dedicate at least a quarter of the NQCC’s access to computing platforms andassociated research programmes towards exploring critical applications ofsocietal beneﬁt, such as realising the advantages from personalised medicine,understanding the causes of dementia or improving battery efﬁciency. This willbe delivered by working with leading UK centres such as the Crick Institute orFaraday Institution.Deliver missions focussed on achieving societal beneﬁts and commercial value,starting with two missions (accelerating quantum technologies for resilientcapabilities in Position Navigation & Timing (PNT), and demonstrating theadvantage of quantum computing). We will consult with the community and keyindustries both domestically and internationally to continue this work bydeveloping a set of longer-term missions over the coming year.Work with relevant leads across government to agree sector or tech speciﬁcaction plans to better articulate the value proposition and resulting actions forenabling technological convergence. Early priorities will be telecoms, defence,space, AI, high performance computing and the semiconductor industries.Expand the use of government procurement, including funding feasibility studiesfor companies to explore useful applications for public sector challenges. We willprovide catalyst funding to enable this, under the next phase of the nationalprogramme, and will kick-start this with an additional £15 million over the nexttwo years.

Set up a government user group to identify where quantum technologies arelikely to offer an advantage to the delivery of public services and other publicgood applications, ways to help enable technology development for publicservice delivery, and ways to upskill government to enable the successfulexploration of potential use cases.
Goal 4: Leading quantum regulation andprotecting the sector
Create a national and international regulatory framework that supportsinnovation and the ethical use of quantum technologies, and protects UKcapabilities and national security
New technologies present many unknowns in terms of regulatory challenges thatmay emerge as our understanding of how they will be used starts to grow. Toprepare for future challenges, it is important to engage early in the debates that willshape future regulation through national and international fora where early work isunderway to identify potential risks associated with the use of new technologies,and to develop shared taxonomies, languages, and principles to guide their futuredevelopment. Eventually new standards, benchmarking and assurance frameworkswill increase in importance to facilitate technological development as use casesbecome more evident, helping to set requirements for interoperability and tomeasure performance within key sectors.
As the quantum sector evolves both nationally and internationally, we mustanticipate and prepare for future regulatory challenges. We will ensure thatregulatory frameworks drive responsible innovation and the delivery of beneﬁts forthe UK, as well as protecting and growing the economy and the UK’s quantumcapabilities.
Quantum regulation will need to be:
Stable, coherent and predictableAgile enough to move quickly with technological developmentSimple to understand and inexpensive to implementWhere possible, co-designed with industryFocussed on innovation and industry-needsChampion the transparent and ethical use of quantum technologies
There is an important opportunity for the UK to be at the forefront of quantumregulation and lead the way in trialling quantum technologies. We also have a keyrole to play in leading the international ethical and regulatory debate to ensure thatregulation supports growth, the ethical use of quantum technologies and the UK’swider interests.

The WEF Global Future Councils (https://www.weforum.org/communities/global-future-councils) network brings together global experts to discuss critical issues,generate insights and analysis, and collaborate in shaping agendas. In 2022, itpublished Quantum Computing Governance Principles(https://www.weforum.org/reports/quantum-computing-governance-principles/) for theresponsible design and adoption of quantum computing for the beneﬁt ofsociety. These principles provide a taxonomy to help inform stakeholders andthe broader public about the areas that quantum computing will have an impactand the opportunities and challenges that arise therewith.
We will:
Ensure that future UK regulation of quantum technologies supports innovation,business growth and the ethical use of quantum technologies across the UKeconomy.Lead the way in trialling quantum technologies in the UK, through establishingregulatory testbeds and sandboxes.Play a leading role, with like-minded partners around the world, to shapeinternational norms and standards relating to quantum technologies includingthose developed by multilateral bodies.Play an active role in the World Trade Organisation, the World Economic Forum,the G7, the G20, OECD, NATO, the Council of Europe, the Commonwealth andthe UN, including utilising the UK seat on the International TelecommunicationsUnion (ITU) to ensure that quantum regulation supports UK business andinnovation, that the UK’s wider prosperity, security and defence interests arerepresented and that we continue to uphold the UK’s values including those onhuman rights.Commission the Regulatory Horizons Council to undertake a regulatory review ofQuantum Technology applications. This will lead to the development of a workprogramme to guide the evolution of proportionate and pro-innovation regulationfor the sector.
Protecting the UK sector to support growth
Whilst the government has an objective to support the growth of the quantumsector which is anticipated to lead to many beneﬁts for society, the economy andnational security, it also has a responsibility to ensure that the use of thesetechnologies does not lead to harm or present a threat to the UK. The strength ofthe UK quantum sector attracts interest from hostile states who seek to developtheir own capabilities or undermine ours. We continue to welcome trade andinvestment while ensuring that we protect the UK effectively from maliciouspractices which could have a damaging impact on our security and prosperity.
We have put in place measures such as the National Security Investment Act 2021,export controls, responsible research programmes, grant agreements and adviceon IP protection to help companies and academic institutions to protect themselvesfrom hostile actors who may seek to exploit their technology or knowledge. These

National Quantum Strategy (accessible webpage) - GOV.UK
measures are designed to support UK companies and research institutions toengage safely with investors, businesses and academics around the world,supporting future scientiﬁc advancements in quantum and enabling the continuedgrowth of the sector.
We will:
Work with our trusted allies to continue to monitor and review the impacts ofcurrent controls on the sector and any future changes to regulation, including theNSI Act, export control regimes, working multilaterally to anticipate future impactsand ensure that regulation aligns with prosperity and security goals.Provide guidance to quantum businesses and researchers on how to work safelywith others and how protect their work and intellectual property, including againstcyber threats.
Key regulatory frameworks
Government guidance for academia (“Trusted Research(https://www.cpni.gov.uk/trusted-research-academia)”) and industry ( “SecureInnovation (https://www.cpni.gov.uk/secure-innovation/company-guidance)”), as wellas wider advice is available through NPSA and NCSC. They seek to supportthe sector in navigating nuanced risks around state threats and the risks tocollaboration, through a better understanding of due diligence on partners,identiﬁcation of high-risk research or organisational key assets alongsideappropriate security governance and risk management, which allows thoseorganisations to make risk-based decisions about how to balance security withopportunity. This includes advice on undertaking security audits and mitigationswith accredited risk consultants.
The Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS)
ATAS applies to all international students and researchers (apart from exemptnationalities) who are subject to UK immigration control and are intending tostudy or research at postgraduate level in certain sensitive subjects.
The subjects and research areas are those where knowledge could be used inprogrammes to develop Advanced Conventional Military Technology (ACMT),weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) or their means of delivery. Researchersand students in these sensitive subjects must apply for an AcademicTechnology Approval Scheme (ATAS) certiﬁcate before they can study or startresearch in the UK.
The National Security and Investment Act (NSIA) (2021)
The NSIA came into force on 4 January 2022, and gives the governmentpowers to scrutinise and intervene in business acquisitions, such as takeovers,that may pose national security risks. It gives businesses and investors a clearand predictable screening process, so that they can continue to invest and dobusiness in the UK with conﬁdence. The Act requires particularly sensitiveacquisitions to be approved by the government before they are completed, and

42/56
[Page #42]
14/10/2023, 16:16
National Quantum Strategy (accessible webpage) - GOV.UK
this includes acquisitions in Quantum Technologies. Extensive guidance on theAct and how quantum technologies come into scope is available at gov.uk(https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-security-and-investment-act).
Export Controls
The UK’s export control regime, delivered by the ECJU, provides aconsolidated framework to ensure that UK exports allow UK business toprosper without posing a threat to national security or violating our internationalcommitments to non-proliferation, as agreed through treaty or multilateralexport control groups such as the Wassenaar Arrangement. As is often thecase for less mature developing technologies, there are few speciﬁc controlstargeting quantum technologies themselves or the goods designed for researchand development of such technologies. It is possible new controls may beintroduced in the future as the technologies mature and their impacts areunderstood.
Mitigating the risks associated with quantum
As with any new technology, risks associated with the use of quantum technologieswill continue to emerge. One of the most well documented is the risk quantumcomputing will pose to national cyber security in the future by threatening thesecurity of much of the existing public-key cryptography, upon which theinformation sharing and trust mechanisms of most modern systems depend.
The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is the UK’s authority for cyber securityand cryptography and has published guidance(https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/whitepaper/preparing-for-quantum-safe-cryptography) on thetransition to quantum-safe cryptography, which is the recommended mitigationagainst this threat once products become available. In terms of government’s ownpreparedness, mitigations have already been put in place for critical informationand services.
NCSC will continue to give bespoke advice to each sector through its resilienceteams, and general advice on quantum-safe cryptography via its website. Moredetailed guidance for quantum-safe cryptography algorithms will follow the outcomeof the NIST process, recommending speciﬁc algorithms for representative usecases.
NCSC’s guidance for mitigating the risks from quantum computing is set outwithin the White Paper “Preparing for Quantum Safe Cryptography”.(https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/whitepaper/preparing-for-quantum-safe-cryptography)
NCSC’s position is that robust and secure transition will take time to plan anddeliver, and there is risk in beginning transition to quantum-safe cryptographybefore standards-compliant products are available. NCSC works withinternational partners to ensure our plans and guidance for transition toquantum-safe cryptography are aligned.

[Page #43]
14/10/2023, 16:16
National Quantum Strategy (accessible webpage) - GOV.UK
There are actions organisations can and should take now to manage that risk.Any organisation that manages their own cryptographic infrastructure shouldfactor quantum-safe transition into their long-term plans and conductinvestigatory work to identify which of their systems will be high priority fortransition once standards-compliant implementations exist. Priority systemscould be those that process sensitive personal data, or the parts of the public-key infrastructure that have certiﬁcate expiry dates far into the future and wouldbe hardest to replace.
Technical Standards
The importance of standards is growing with the increasing globalisation ofcommerce, the emergence of new technologies and the need for interoperability. Astechnology progresses from initial research to prototype and product developmenttechnical standards become increasingly important, for example by supporting theconsistent measurement of technology performance.
Different types of standards activity will be relevant at different levels of maturity:from identifying critical measurements and taxonomies as part of basic research, tothe metrics and benchmarking of prototypes, and the interoperability andcertiﬁcation of commercial quantum products. Different quantum technologies arelikely to mature at different rates.
While supporting the development of standards will be important to advancing opentechnological development, interoperability and trade, these activities need to takeplace at the right time to avoid stiﬂing innovation by setting boundaries andrequirements too early in the process. There is also a need to mitigate the risks ofstandards being developed by those who do not share our values and in a way thatdoes not support the UK economy. Engagement with key stakeholders and expertsin speciﬁc areas of quantum technology research and innovation will be critical togovernment developing an understanding of this balance.
There are a number of early quantum standardisation activities taking placeglobally with signiﬁcant focus on quantum safe cryptography and QKD, with UKleadership in these areas. Standards development organisations with activity onquantum technology include: International Organization for Standardization (ISO);International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC); International TelecommunicationUnion (ITU); Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF); the EuropeanTelecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI); and the Institute of Electrical andElectronics Engineers (IEEE).
We will:
Work through relevant global bodies to ensure that global quantum technicalstandards promote our prosperity and security interests, including acceleratingcommercialisation of quantum technologies and supporting the sector here in theUKWork with key partners (e.g. the British Standards Institute, the National PhysicalLaboratory and MOD) to scope and identify the best approach to coordinating

National Quantum Strategy (accessible webpage) - GOV.UK
national engagement in priority areas of quantum technical standardsdevelopment. Relevant industry, and academia will be engaged in these effortsto track priority standards activity, raise stakeholder awareness and developroadmaps to support UK engagement with quantum standards development.
Existing UK governance of quantum technical standards
Quantum computing, quantum communications, quantum imaging andquantum sensors and timing are at different stages of standardisation activityand spread across several different International Standards DevelopmentOrganisations (SDOs). The National Physical Laboratory (NPL) has raisedawareness of relevant standards activity amongst the Research Hubs, and hasinitiated engagement with the National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST) in the US.
The British Standards Institute (BSI) coordinates UK engagement in quantumstandards activity at ISO/IEC and at the European level in CEN/CENELEC. ABSI committee for quantum standards was established with NPL support inMarch 2021. So far its main activity has been to mirror and contribute toISO/IEC/JTC 1/WG 14, Quantum Computing, and to the CEN/CENELEC FocusGroup on Quantum Technologies (FGQT).
Within government DSIT is responsible for quantum technology policy and forpolicy on digital technical standards, which includes standards for quantum andrelated technologies such as AI and telecommunications. Standards oversightand leadership will be provided by DSIT through partnership with NPL andBSI,bringing in other key organisations such as NCSC and NQCC in theirparticular ﬁelds.
Assurance of quantum technologies
Users of quantum technologies and other emerging technologies require someconﬁrmation of the reliability, cost effectiveness, safety and security of the productsor services that they want to acquire. Testing and evaluation as well as widerassurance plays a critical role in demonstrating that the technologies do what theysay they will.
It is too early in the development pathway of many quantum technologies toestablish full assurance frameworks for their use, however extensive work hasbeen undertaken at NPL and elsewhere to develop effective testing and evaluationtechniques, working with industry through ISCF Quantum Challenge projects andtheir Quantum Testing and Evaluation (QTE) Programme. This will stand them ingood stead for the development of future frameworks.
The NQCC and the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) are also working to developopen standards that build on benchmarking tools commissioned by the NQCC toenable comparisons to be drawn between competing quantum platforms. NPL and

[Page #45]
14/10/2023, 16:16
National Quantum Strategy (accessible webpage) - GOV.UK
NQCC will develop an assurance and benchmarking programme of work to sitalongside the standards roadmap.
Security assurance is as important as performance assurance to provide users withthe conﬁdence to invest in or adopt these technologies. As such, good securityprinciples established by NCSC and set out in the Cyber Security Strategy 2022should be adhered to and security must be seen as an enabler rather than aninhibitor or commercial success. By reducing cyber risks in their interactions withother businesses or users via the cloud, as well as ensuring quantum technologiesare secure by design, quantum companies can maximise the economic beneﬁtsassociated with quantum technologies. As set out in the Cyber Security Strategy,NCSC will work with the National Quantum Technologies Programme to develop asecurity model for quantum computers, which will help companies to design securearchitectures, building on the Digital Security by Design programme and willcontinue to offer guidance to quantum companies to help them to operate safely onthe cloud.
The Quantum Metrology Institute at the National Physical Laboratory
The Quantum Metrology Institute (QMI) at NPL was established in 2015 as partof the ﬁrst phase of the National Quantum Technologies Programme. The QMIbrings together all NPL’s capabilities in science, metrology and major facilitiesrelevant to the understanding, development and test of quantum technologies.The QMI is a national capability for test and evaluation, accelerating thecommercialisation of quantum technologies.
NPL teams work in collaboration with industry and academic partners acrossthe country focused on multiple scientiﬁc areas including quantum clocks,quantum communications, quantum computing, quantum sensors and quantummaterials. Facilities are available to test and characterise materials,components and systems from the full range of technology areas.
NPL offers schemes for industry to access these facilities and opportunities tocollaborate with NPL scientists and engineers to address barriers to innovation,reliability and scaling of quantum systems.
To expand these national capabilities in support of the quantum economy, anew facility – the Advanced Quantum Metrology Laboratory (AQML) – has beenconstructed on the NPL Teddington site. The AQML will give NPL even greatercapacity to support the UK in the successful commercialisation and adoption ofquantum technologies.
Conclusion
The potential beneﬁts and opportunities of quantum technologies are vast and willoffer advantages to the UK in meeting our economic, security, climate, health andsocietal aims. We are in a strong position to be a world-leading quantum nation, but

National Quantum Strategy (accessible webpage) - GOV.UK
we must continue to be bold and ambitious in our approach if we are to capitaliseon our strengths and bolster our position in the global race.
This strategy set out our deep long-term commitment to quantum technologies inthe UK and the actions we will take to build on our advantages across a broadrange of quantum technologies.
To conclude, we will ensure that the UK is a leading quantum nation, building onthe years of investment and progress already made in the vibrant UK quantumecosystem. We will invest – at scale and over the long-term – in the cutting-edgescience and the people who will deliver our success. We will support our quantumbusinesses who are driving the commercialisation of the technology and ensuringthat the ideas and knowledge are translated into products and services that can beused across the economy to deliver beneﬁts to all our citizens. We will workinternationally to share and increase knowledge, build secure supply chains andcollaborate on the most pro-innovation and ethical global governance andregulation of quantum technologies.
In the words of the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, ‘Wewill make the UK the home for cutting-edge scientiﬁc breakthroughs, the best placein the world to start and grow a quantum business, a leading voice in theinternational quantum and tech community, and a magnet for international quantumtalent.’
At this relatively early stage in the development of quantum technologies, ourapproach is to strengthen the entire quantum ecosystem, by applying all the leversthat the government has available. As the technology matures, and the successfultechnical solutions in particular areas become clearer, our programme might needto change and become more tailored. Engaging with the UK quantum community tounderstand what is working, and how the support needs to adapt, will be anessential part of our approach. We will consult widely on the design of the futureprogramme.
Implementation
To achieve this ambitious programme of work we will bring a rigorous approach toimplementation and delivery. This will be a collaborative effort across government,academia and industry, and with our international partners. A new Ofﬁce forQuantum will be the engine of our ambition, based in DSIT but integratingknowledge and expertise from across the community and will:
Report progress on delivery to the National Science and Technology Council,chaired by the Prime Minister, given quantum’s strategic importance. Thiscontinued engagement at the most senior levels of government is required tomaintain long-term momentum, respond to new developments, and ensure join-up with other priority technologies.Establish a new strategy programme board, composed of the lead deliverydepartments to govern the implementation of this strategy, and ensure that thefull range of government levers, across public investment in R&D, trade,
