Chris Skidmore publishes his Net Zero Review, setting out the ‘historicopportunity’ offered by net zeroformer energy minister says the UK’s leadership on tackling climate changehas led to changes at home and around the world – with more than 90% ofthe world’s GDP now committed to net zeroreview makes 129 recommendations, all to seize opportunities from creatinga green economy
The UK’s leadership on tackling climate change has delivered real change at homeand led to a global transformation – but more should be done to reap the economicbeneﬁts that presents, Chris Skidmore says today.
Mission Zero, his Net Zero Review, makes 129 recommendations covering areasincluding the greater role that business can be supported to play, making better useof infrastructure and delivering more energy efﬁcient homes. Every one is designedto maximise economic investment, opportunities and jobs – all while workingtowards achieving legally binding targets to reach net zero carbon emissions by2050.
He urges ministers to grasp the ‘historic opportunity’, highlighting how thegovernment’s Net Zero Strategy offers the right direction, and the right policies todo so.
Chair of the Net Zero Review, Chris Skidmore MP, said:

Net Zero Review: UK could do more to reap economic beneﬁts of green growth - GOV.UK
We should be proud of the lead the UK has taken in tackling climate change,having exceeded expectations so far in our race to net zero emissions by 2050.As essential as that is environmentally, it also puts us at an economicadvantage globally.
“
We lead in areas including clean technologies, science, manufacturing andgreen ﬁnance – areas that, if managed right, can lead to new jobs and strongeconomic growth.
“
In developing this report, we have engaged with communities, economists andclimate experts from across the country through more than 50 roundtables and1800 submissions – all of which have led to the Mission Zero ﬁndings.
“
My recommendations are designed to make the most of this historicopportunity, covering the length and breadth of our economy, so that people inevery part of the country can reap the beneﬁts of this both in their communities,and in their pockets.”
Business and Energy Secretary Grant Shapps said:
“
With a wealth of talent and expertise, and a track record to be proud of, the UKis well placed to ensure that tackling climate change also brings new jobs andinvestment for businesses and communities.
“
I am grateful to Chris Skidmore – the man who signed our climatecommitments into law – for his detailed report today, which offers a range ofideas and innovations for us to consider as we work to grasp the opportunitiesfrom green growth.”
Chris Skidmore’s proposals include:
backing business – these include reviewing incentives for investment indecarbonisation, including via the tax system, and launching a Help to GrowGreen campaign offering information and advice to small businesses so they canplan aheadbacking local action – these include reforming the planning system to put netzero at its heart nationally and locally, and backing at least one Trailblazer NetZero City, local authority and community that can work towards reaching net zeroby 2030delivering energy efﬁcient homes – including legislating for the Future HomesStandard so that no new homes will be built with a gas boiler from 2025,adopting a 10-year mission to make heat pumps a widespread technology in theUKusing infrastructure to unlock net zero – including developing a cross-sectoralinfrastructure strategy by 2025 to support the building and adaptation for newgreen energy sources such as hydrogen to support the green economy
Ofﬁcial statistics show there are already around 400,000 jobs in low carbonbusinesses and their supply chains across the UK, with turnover estimated at £41.2billion in 2020. Both the British Energy Security Strategy

Notes to editors
Responses to today’s review include:
Chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the LondonSchool of Economics and Political Science, Professor Lord Stern ofBrentford, said:
“
Chris Skidmore and his team deserve great credit for carrying out a rigorous,robust, and inclusive review of the evidence on the economics of the UK’s net-zero transition. In particular, the review has argued convincingly that thetransition to a net-zero economy is the growth opportunity of the 21st century,and the UK is well-placed to beneﬁt from the increasing demand for net-zerogoods and services, if it makes the right public and private investments. It alsocorrectly highlights the critical importance of government creating anenvironment that is conducive to this investment by providing clarity, certainty,consistency and continuity of policy. I hope the Prime Minister and hisgovernment will respond to the review with the urgency and scale required toprevent this enormous economic opportunity from slipping through our ﬁngers.This transition, and the investment and innovation it embodies, are at the coreof the UK’s growth story for the coming decade.”
Executive Director of the Aldersgate Group, Nick Molho, said:
“
The Skidmore Review is absolutely right to emphasise that the net zerotransition is a major pro-business and pro-investment opportunity. Businesseshave long recognised this, a fact that is reﬂected in the rapidly growing numberthat are taking on ambitious net zero emission targets backed by clear deliverystrategies. In the challenging economic and social context currently faced bythe UK, a rapid shift towards net zero offers much needed investment,competitiveness and job creation opportunities for UK businesses andinvestors in varied sectors such as construction, energy, manufacturing,engineering, transport and ﬁnance.
“
The ﬁndings and recommendations of the Skidmore Review are based on animpressively comprehensive engagement with businesses and civil society,which provides a direct window into what businesses, public bodies and civilsociety need from the UK government to deliver net zero and secure theeconomic opportunities associated with it. The government should use therecommendations of this review to produce an updated and strengthened NetZero Strategy early this year. It should also crack on with some of the mostpressing policy recommendations highlighted in the report, such as on gridinfrastructure, full power sector decarbonisation, energy efﬁciency in homes,

resource efﬁciency, and business models to support the roll out of CCS,hydrogen and other low carbon solutions urgently needed by heavy industry.”
Chief Executive of Aviva, Amanda Blanc, said:
“
I congratulate Chris and his team on such a comprehensive and ambitiousReview. I hope both the government and opposition parties will take carefulnote of it and together act swiftly on its recommendations. In particular, as co-chair of the UK Transition Plan Taskforce, I strongly agree that the governmentshould put in place its own ‘clear, consistent and stable transition plan’ settingout the detail of how the UK will meet its climate commitments. In turn, this willunlock the business actions and investment needed to make the transition areality.”

The main recommendations to the government in the Review are as follows:
1) Using infrastructure to unlock net zero
accelerating the implementation of the British Energy Security Strategy to updatethe mandate of Ofgem, creating the Future System Operator and acceleratingthe connection of cheaper renewables such as solar and onshore winddeveloping a cross-sectoral infrastructure strategy by 2025 supporting thebuilding and adaptation of infrastructure for electricity, hydrogen, other liquid andgaseous fuels and CO2 networks that support the green economyreforming our approach to planning, so that where locally supported, more solarand onshore wind can be developed more easily, helping communities reap thebeneﬁts of cheaper low-carbon electricity
2) Creating sustainable governance structures for net zero
developing an over-arching government ﬁnancing strategy by the end of 2023establishing an Ofﬁce for Net Zero Delivery, responsible for placing net zerodelivery at the heart of government thinking
3) Backing businesses to go green
reviewing incentives for investment in decarbonisation, including via the taxsystem and capital allowances, and protecting British industries fromenvironmental undercutting by progressing plans on carbon leakage measuresand providing more detail on the UK’s new Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS)building skills needed for the transition by driving forward the Green JobsTaskforce recommendations and launching a ‘Help to Grow Green’ campaign,offering information and support to SMEs to plan and invest in the transition

4) Catalysing local action
reforming the planning system at local and national level to place net zero at itsheartback at least one Trailblazer Net Zero City, local authority and community, withthe aim for these places to reach net zero by 2030
5) Increasing transparency and engaging people
expanding the government’s public reporting on net zeroramping up public information through a new engagement plan, a new carboncalculator on the carbon cost of choices, and a standardised approach toecolabelling on productsdeveloping a Net Zero Charter mark, acknowledging ‘best in class’ among ﬁrmsfor their work in reaching net zero
6) Delivering cleaner, cheaper, greener homes
legislating for the Future Homes Standard, meaning no new homes will be builtwith a gas boiler from 2025, and for all homes sold to be EPC C by 2033adopting a 10-year mission to make heat pumps a widespread technology in theUK and legislate for the end of new and replacement gas boilers by 2033 at thelatestreforming EPC ratings to create a clearer, more accessible Net ZeroPerformance Certiﬁcate (NZPC) for households
7) Capitalising on international leadership
conducting a strategic review on the UK’s international climate leadership andintroduce environmental and climate protections in future free trade agreements,removing trade barriers to environmental goods and services
8) Setting ourselves up for 2050 and beyond
ramping up investment in research and development (R&D), with a new net zeroR&D and technologies roadmap up to 2050, supporting up to 3 10-yeardemonstrator projects
Mr Skidmore was commissioned to lead his rapid review of the government’sapproach to delivering its net zero target by former Secretary of State for Businessand Energy Jacob Rees-Mogg last September. It followed major changes to theeconomic and political landscape, with Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine,historically high global energy prices and high inﬂation.
The Review is split into 2 parts, with the ﬁrst part exploring the opportunity, andbeneﬁts to individuals and the economy, emphasising that the UK must go furtherand faster to realise economic beneﬁts. The second part sets out a roadmap for

how government and industry can work to better exploit the opportunities andcatalyse action in individual sectors of the economy, enhancing the role of localauthorities, communities, and the individual to deliver the green transition.
The review was informed through a call for evidence and direct engagement withbusinesses, organisations, local government, academia and the public. The NetZero Review travelled to all 4 nations of the UK, received over 1800 responses tothe call for evidence, and heard evidence at more than 50 roundtables across thecountry, making it one of the largest engagement exercises on net zero delivery inthe UK.
