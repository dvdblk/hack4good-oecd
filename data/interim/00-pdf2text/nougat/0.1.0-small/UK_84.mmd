## Introduction

Climate change and environmental issues at work are increasingly moving up the trade union agenda. Unions are working together and forming partnerships to tackle what is seen by many as the biggest issue of the twenty-first century. And one aspect of this is the way that unions will work to ensure workers have an opportunity to develop the new skills needed for a low-carbon economy.

Developing green skills at work has the potential to offer a wide range of exciting opportunities to workers across the UK, and the trade union movement will be leading the way in supporting the fight against climate change and helping workers build the skills that will be part of the solution.

The TUC is calling for a just transition for workers and this new publication from unionlearn explains the facts around what just transition is and what unions are doing to ensure their members are not left behind. It also explores the role of the trade union green or environmental rep, the training available and the skills that will be needed in the future.

Through information and case studies, along with signposting to courses and resources, this booklet aims to be a practical guide to union reps and members that will give them the tools needed to be part of the solution, as the world faces up to the climate crisis.

Throughout **Cutting Carbon**, Growing Sidles** are stories of initiatives run by unions and reps that show what can be done, and this will encourage others to follow their lead by organising activities and projects or develop skills of their own.

I hope this booklet will inspire a new generation of reps to get involved with environmental issues in their workplaces and support working people benefit from a just transition where clean, green jobs support the growth of a low-carbon economy that will see trade unions leading the way.

CASE STUDY

TOLPUDLE MARTYRS' FESTIVAL

REDUCES ITS CARBON FOOTPRINT

When it comes to meeting

the challenge of the climate

emergency, the Tolpuddle

Martyrs' Festival does

not merely talk the talk

by foregrounding green

issues on the festival fringe.

It also walks the walk by

working with organisers,

stallholders, campaigners

and visitors, to reduce the

environmental impact of the

three-day event, which is

held every July in the Dorset

 village that was home to the

six farmworkers transported

to Australia for forming a

trade union in 1834.

With the signi cant

increases in energy, water,

food and waste generated

by the festival, let alone the

apparently ever-increasing

number of similar events

throughout the summer

months, Tolpuddle's

organisers are doing all

they can to minimise the

the environmental impact of

the event.

festival has also almost entirely replaced the tens of thousands of cable ties it used to get through each year.

"We asked ourselves what people used to do before cable ties and the answer, of course, was string, so we've been investing in all sorts of di erent kinds of string to put up banners and attach bits of equipment - and it's fabulous!" Tom says.

"We have completely eliminated single-use plastic in the shop - the drinks we sell are either in glass bottles or cans that can be recycled," Tom says. "And we have moved on from that to make the festival plastic bottle-free as well."

Even those small number of visitors who do arrive with the plastic bottles they may have bought en route can he'll them with tap water now that the museum has become a Re ll Station, which it did in June 2019, enabling visitors, walkers, hikers and cyclists to stay hydrated without having to buy a plastic bottle. (The app-enabled initiative is run by City To Sea, which is also based in the south-west.)

But combatting single-use plastic is not only about eliminating the need for plastic bottles. The festival has also almost entirely replaced the tens of thousands of cable ties it used to get through each year.

"We asked ourselves what people used to do before cable ties and the answer, of course, was string, so we've been investing in all sorts of di erent kinds of string to put up banners and attach bits of equipment - and it's fabulous!" Tom says.

"The cable tie will have a legacy in the environment for decades to come and may end up somewhere where it could cause real harm so we think twice before using them now - and it's really not that hard."

The festival is also working very closely with all the organisations that come onto the site (stallholders, campaign groups, catering companies) to keep plastic to an absolute minimum.

"We've had problems in the past with organisations during out plastic freebies that are destined to end up in land II, so we have been getting out the message that that kind of stu isn't welcome here - it's not what we should be doing and it doesn't inspire people!" Tom says.

## 10.11 Extreme weather events

The flooding in Indonesia and the devastating fires in Australia in 2020 are part of a huge increase in extreme weather-related events. Climate change has increased recent extreme rainfall and associated floods; coastal flooding due to sea-level rise; heatwaves in Australia, China and Europe; and increased the risk of wildfires, with implications for humans and animals, the environment and the economy. Data from the European Academies Science Advisory Council (EASAC) published in March 2018, highlights the quadrupling of floods and other hydrological events since 19So. Climatological events such as extreme temperatures, droughts and forest fires, have more than doubled since 1980. Meteorological events such as storms, have doubled since 1980.

The ITUC has established a just transition centre that has resources for union engagement on this issue.

The centre shares union experiences of just transition across the world from Norway to Nigeria and Canada to New Zealand. For example, the FN, a Dutch trade union, describes how it is making sure fossil energy sector workers are not left behind as the country is transitioning into climate-sustainable energy production.

### Climate proo ng agreements

In June 2019, the ITUC announced a day of global action on climate change. It called on unions to find out their employers' plans to climate-proof their operations and jobs. A campaign guide provided resources for the global day of workplace action, including a model letter to send to employers, and questions to ask in the meeting.

Unions were invited by the ITUC to put questions to their employers:

1 Do you measure CO\({}_{2}\) emissions? If yes, can we develop a plan for reducing emissions? If no, can we agree to a process to measure our emissions?
2. Will we have net-zero emissions by 2050 or have a 50 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030?

3. What will we do to get there?

The ITUC guide contains a model letter that includes the three questions. If your employer has not given you any of this information, then adapting the letter and using it could be a good way of starting to find out what your employer has and hasn't done.

The Canadian Task Force's Final Report by the Task Force on Just Transition for Canadian Coal Power Workers and Communities from z018 (canada.

ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/task-force-just-transition/nel-report.html) contained a range of measures that included the creation of:* a detailed and publicly available inventory with labour market information pertaining to coal workers, such as skills profiles, demographics, locations, and current and potential employers
* a comprehensive funding programme for workers staying in the labour market to address their needs across the stages of securing a new job, including income support, education and skills building, re-employment and mobility.

## The UK perspective

The UK government has yet to implement the just transition principles of the Paris or Silesia Agreements. Previously, it had established a Green Economy Council (GEC) in 2011 with membership from the TUC, although this has now been disbanded. It also established a working group to review sustainability in industrial strategy with particular reference to skills. It's written evidence suggested that "To go further, both government and industry should give consideration to our conclusions above, which emphasize the desirability of continued partnership working to develop and deepen the sustainability that already exists in industrial strategy.Green Economy Council (2014) Review of Sustainability in Industrial Strategy. [http://data.parliament.uk/wittenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/environmental-audit-committee/a-201015-progress-report/written/17992.pdf](http://data.parliament.uk/wittenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/environmental-audit-committee/a-201015-progress-report/written/17992.pdf)

The trade union members of this working group submitted their concerns about the lack of effective mechanisms for both sustainability and trade union consultation. The GEC didn't meet again, but there is a union seat on the Industrial Strategy Council.

The Committee on Climate Change report Net-Zero: the UK's contribution to stopping global warming, commented that "It is vital that the UK's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) that is submitted under the terms of the Paris Agreement contains a reference to just transition and the mechanisms to engage with trade unions as key stakeholders." theccc.org.uk/publication/net-zero-the-ulks-contribution-to-stopping-global-warming

The 2014 GEC report addressed the issue of procurement and supply chains: "We conclude that greater encouragement to bids that would support supply chains in 'green growth' areas, and ideas or projects demonstrating a high degree of environmental sustainability, would be advantageous.To give meaning to this, union members on the committee made a specific call for each industry council to draft guidelines on sustainable procurement as a practical demonstration of the stated aim to give "**greater encouragement to bids**Despite this, the growth of outsourcing has led to many contracts that could sustain jobs in the manufacturing supply chain in the UK ending up overseas.

Unions are leading the calls for investment in green jobs and the motion on industrial strategy passed at the TUC Congress in 2019 called for a "procurement policy that supports a 'build local' strategy to reduce our carbon footprint and invest in skilled jobs and apprenticeships.""TUC Congress in 2019 called for a procurement policy that supports a 'build local' strategy to reduce our carbon footprint and invest in skilled jobs and apprenticeships."

### The Scottish experience

A Just Transition Commission (gov.scot/groups/ just-transition-commission ) was established in 2018. There are two trade union members on the commission and it will report back to the Scottish Government at the end of 2020. This is a positive step and the Commission will be making recommendations covering five sectors and three cross-cutting policy areas:

 ) power generation and transmission

 ) transport/buildings and the public sector

 ) oil and gas

 ) land and agriculture

 ) energy intensive industries

 ) finance and investment/business

 ) innovation and delivery at scale

 ) skills and labour market/education.

The interim report of the Just Transition Commission has highlighted trade union concerns:

"There are other reasons for Scotland's failure to capture opportunities in the renewables sector that we could point to. Trade unions made representations to us that domestic rms are operating on an unfair playing eld with foreign competitors, leading to them losing out on potential business. The subsidy mechanism to support renewable energy (Contracts for Di erence), operated by the UK government, was also said to have not been e active at driving local supply chain content in developments. But nonetheless, failure to plan and invest long-term appears to have been a signi cart factor."gov.scot/publications/transition- commission-interim-report/pages/5

A classic case of the consequence of failing to address the concerns of unions can be found in the offshore wind sector in Scotland. The potential for job creation within this sector has been compromised by the failure to award contracts to the Scottish renewable sector and associated supply chains. gmb.org.uk/news/joint-union-statement-bifab

The Scottish Government has made the concept of "Fair Work' central to economic strategy, with ambitions to be a world-leading "Fair Work Nation" by 2025. One delivery mechanism for achieving this is the promotion of Fair Work First, which seeks to extend Fair Work criteria to funding streams, business support grants and public contracts. In practice this should mean that to receive support, businesses are asked to commit to:

 ) investment in skills and training

 ) no inappropriate use of zero-hours contracts

 ) action to tackle the gender pay gap

 ) genuine workforce engagement including with trade unions

 ) paying the real living wage.

From the interim report of the Scottish Just Transition Commission:

"Across sectors of the climate change plan, government spends money supporting businesses to deliver programmes that deliver emission reductions. Whether funding is granted by government, or through a delivery partner organisation, we would expect the Fair Work First approach to be the norm."

The Scottish TUC (STUC), which is represented on the commission, has welcomed the interim report and issued this statement: stuc.org.uk/media-centre/news/1410/stuc-response-to-the-just-transition- commission-interim-reportAnd central to the work of the task force is its training programme.

"Our main job is to inform union reps in those industries about what the issues are, how they can go about challenging some of the decisions that certain rms are making and how to get these issues on the collective bargaining agenda," Bill says.

"It's about helping them develop the skills to get involved, to have their feet under the negotiating table right at the start and in some cases lead from the front in terms of what needs doing."

The just transition course enables learners to:

"I wanted to create a new and international climate change policy means for their workplace and region

"I wanted to create a new course that will give people the ideas to get them thinking and all the skills to go out and do something about it - social media

"I wanted to create a new and bargaining skills in the workplace," Rob says.

With the pressure of dealing with day-to-day industrial issues, union reps may feel they have enough on their plates without having to engage with green issues, Bill points out.

"The government passed an act of parliament to say that companies need to be zero-carbon by 2050, so they need to get on with it. And given the changing, o en devastating, weather we are seeing, the sooner the better."

### Women and climate change

Globally, climate change disproportionately affects women. UN figures show that 80 per cent of those displaced by climate change are women. Women are also more likely to rely on public transport and are more likely to lack the technical skills needed for a green transition.

At the 2020 TUC Women's Conference held at Congress House in March, the TUC Women's Committee released a statement addressing the issue:

"The recent floods across much of the UK is just one example of the extreme weather we are seeing across regional strategies

around 100 local authorities had declared climate emergencies by the beginning of 2020. These declarations need to be accompanied by detailed plans for reducing emissions if they are to be meaningful. Unions need to be engaged with these since they will impact workers in that area both directly and indirectly.

In 2018, the Greener Jobs Alliance (GJA) published a just transition statement (greenerjobsalliance.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/JustTransitionJointStatement-FINAL_pollthat contained three demands:
The role of the green or environmental rep

The increased profile of climate change has started to impact on union organisation. More unions are reviewing how they respond to the issue. For some unions it has led to an increased focus on branch organisation. In some places they are referred to as green reps but this is not a universal term. They may be known as environment rep, climate rep, sustainability rep and in a way the title is not important. The most important thing is that in each workplace there is at least one person taking responsibility for the impact of climate change measures on employment.

There is currently no legal right to appoint union reps to represent workers on this issue. In 2017, the TUC Congress passed a motion calling on unions to "lobby to demand rights for workplace environments"."In addition to changes in the law, amendments should be made to the Acas code of practice "Time off for trade union duties and activities". This would allow facility time for:

> appropriate training

> conducting environment- and climate-

related audits

> raising issues with the employer.

There is of course a big crossover with other industrial relations matters. In some union branches it will be the health and safety rep that takes on this role. The advantage of this approach is these reps do have legal rights under the Safety Reps Regulations 1977: On the issue of green skills, other reps with legal rights, like union learning reps, may also play a role.

lead with that. They have made the sessions short, informative and engaging. There really is no reason why other employers can't work with us to do the same - many are doing some great things around the environment!" Beyond the work with Greggs, the BFAWU has been collating green surveys that were completed at their annual conference and various regional meetings. Sarah said this has shown there is an interest from reps who attended the sessions have given very positive feedback, mainly about being more aware of their own behaviour and how they can make a di erence in their shops or at home.

### Green reps and climate emergencies

Many employers in the public and private sector have declared climate emergencies. In some cases, they have committed to a target to reduce their carbon emissions to net-zero by a certain date. This presents an opportunity for unions to incorporate climate-related issues in the collective bargaining process. Issues like skills and recruitment can be linked to the ability of the employer to meet carbon targets. Where employers have not declared an emergency or clearly identified their carbon emissions, there is an opportunity for the union to initiate a discussion.

The functions of a green rep will be influenced by their sector of employment but are likely to include the type of activities covered below:

1. Raising awareness and promoting green workplace practices with members, such as reducing waste, recycling, energy saving, green purchasing.
2. Liaising with the branch on green and sustainability issues that need to be raised with management.
3. Taking forward and promoting union policy and campaigns on green and sustainability issues in the branch, eg on energy, climate change and fair trade.
4. Carrying out workplace environmental audits.
5. Monitoring employers' activity on, or progress towards, green and sustainability policies and targets.
6. Involvement in developing best environmental practice in the workplace, eg through committees and working parties, developing environmental policies and management systems, and drawing up workplace agreements etc.
7. Networking with other green reps to share information and good practice. Extract from PCS guidance: www.pcs.org.uk/resources/green-workplaces/green-reps

### Increasing membership awareness

A key function of a green rep will be raising the awareness of members about climate change issues and the role of the union. This may create the conditions for members to play a more active role in the branch and reinforce support for union initiatives.

## Appendix C Case Study

BRISTOL UNIONS UNITED WORK TO GREEN HORIZON HOUSE

Union reps from PCS

and UNISON working for

di erent organisations in

the same building in Bristol

have created a cross-union

committee to advance

their environmental and

industrial agendas.

England, the Animal & Plant

Health Agency and the

Rural Payments Agency - all

represented by PCS.

Bristol Unions United, the

cross-union committee

covering the building, is

pursuing a multi-stranded

campaign that combines

educational events on

pressing environmental

concerns with a negotiating

agenda that encompasses

climate justice and

industrial issues.

"We had around 40

colleagues listening

atentively to a 14-year-

old and a 15-year-old

explaining what they

take on the green rep role

in addition to his workplace

where the school children

the pros and cons ofcarbon o setting and a packed event in February 2020, looking at how the council is addressing the urgent need to decrease air pollution in the city, which has been shown to cause 300 avoidable deaths every year.

Speakers included Council for Kye Dudd, who is not only the city council's cabinet member for transport and energy but also chair of the local Communication Workers Union (CWU) branch; Harriet Aughey from MedAct Bristol, who is a paediatric registrar at University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust; and Stuart Phelps, from local campaign group Residents Against Dirty Energy (RADE). The issue was so urgent and the speakers so gripping, that it was standing room only in the atrium and sta on the rst floor were leaving their desks to listen in from their vantage point overlooking the meeting.

workers' issues, because that's where we can be most powerful." For Tom himself, taking part in the annual PCS green forum in Leeds last year was an enormous help to him developing in his role as green rep.

"Getting together with other reps around the country at the green forum was really key," he recalls. "Swapping notes on some of the organising challenges we've faced and the di erent events and tools we'd use to get people together more e actively - that was really vital."CASE STUDY

Simon said: "The

provide a space for

personnel to reflect,

especially a er such tragic

recent incidents, while

also bene tting the local

environment by greening

otherwise grey roof terraces

and helping to improve

air quality. They provide

an oasis for biodiversity,

including planting for

pollinators such as bees

and butterflies."Simon became LFB's _rst green champion and gives presentations to _re_ service _sta_ on how they can make _workplaces more eco-friendly.

Getting the employer on board was hard work but worth it, as Simon explained: "To be honest, at _rst_ it was di cult to _get green actions on the agenda, but slowly but _surely_ I chipped away and never gave up."

"As a _re_ ghter, I don't _give up easily. It's taken a decade of hard work, but the door is _nally_ open!"

Simon feels that _re_ ghters _are on the frontline of the changing climate, saying "When you see the floods, it's _re_ ghters _wading down high streets and in boats, or we're _chasing wild res."_

Simon has recently been working in collaboration with Avon Fire & Rescue Service, and they have created a new training guidance tool which is available to all sta.

Simon explained: "This new _learning tool shows there _is plenty _re_ crews can do _in the union, saying: "It's early days, but I hope the union green rep role within the FBU will develop across the country. We now have another rep in Region 9 and we are working together to raise the _pro_ le of why _re_ ghters are at the forefront of the climate emergency."_

"Learning is a bit like _gardening: once that seed is planted, you nurture it _and then it just takes o. We're always busy but you can always _nd_ time. And when you go for it, just see what happens."What skills will workes need for a low-carbon economy?

The answer to this may seem obvious. Skills related to jobs in the renewable sector, construction and waste management are normally mentioned when this question comes up. Skills linked to wind turbine installation, energy efficiency etc. will be vital but the key point is that every job will require green skills. There is no common approach to, and thus no definition of, green skills and jobs. Even within countries, it has often been hard for the concept to be pinned down and sometimes definitions continue to evolve.

A general conclusion from Cedefop's report (see "Skills for Green jobs' box on page 23) is that:

"There tends to be a weak connection between organisations involved in national policy making on environmental topics and those involved in labour markets and skills policy, including skills anticipation. This parallels a generally weak connection between environmental and skills policies. There are also gaps in policies and regulations in relation to gender issues and to monitoring and evaluation of policies or activities relevant to green skills."

The types of skills and the number of jobs in each sector of the economy needs to be based on research and consultation across each sector of employment. This has been recognised by the Scottish Just Transition Commission in its interim report from 2020:

"There is a great deal of information and research regarding the number of jobs that may result from investment in a net-zero economy. However, what these job numbers mean in terms of job quality (contractual security, skills, earnings, voice) and the extent to which they o er fair work, is too o en unclear. More understanding is also needed on the scope of the 'just transition challenge' in Scotland - for instance, detailed mapping of jobs and skills in both existing and emerging industries will help shape transition plans."

There is a crucial research role here for the education sector in collaboration with employers, unions and local and national authorities.

to households to carry out energy

e ciency improvements. There were

plans to create 1,000 apprenticeships.

The high interest rates for the loans

linked to the scheme and consumer-

demand approach adopted led to

a very low take up. Small building

companies that had invested money

in to recruiting and training sta went

bankrupt. Colleges that had invested

in developing green construction

centres had to close them due to lack of

demand for training. This was also at a

time when the further education sector

was experiencing huge cuts in funding

provision. It turned out be a classic

example of how not to develop a green

skills strategy and the importance of

long-term planning rather than a short-

term, market-led approach.

Matching up skills policy with

industrial strategy

The UK record on matching demand for green

skills with the supply has not been helped by the

constant changes in skills policy, In July 2017, the

independent Industrial Strategy Commission (ISC)

published a report called Laying the Foundations.

"Skills policy must focus on addressing the UK's

historic de cit in skills and on better utilising skills

to drive higher growth and productivity. Skills policy

must be more stable and holistic in its approach and

needed to both increase the overall supply of general growth and productivity."

technical skills and to develop the speci c skills

needed for particular sectors and places."

### Green skills manifesto

The green skills manifesto (greenerjobsalliance.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Green_

skills_manifesto_2013_to_print_1_compressed.pdf) was launched by the Greener Jobs Alliance in 2013 to address the concerns about the lack of alignment between green skills and jobs. The five underlying principles in the manifesto remain relevant today:

**1. Equalities:**Many of the potential low-carbon

growth areas like construction and engineering

do not adequately reflect the potential workforce.

The under-representation in apprenticeships and employment in these sectors must be addressed

to ensure access to job opportunities by all

 disadvantaged groups. A recognition that climate

change and energy prices will hit the poorest

sections of society hardest.

**2. Fair and decent jobs:**The move to a low-carbon

economy must be based on fair wages and

decent terms and conditions of employment.

These should include opportunities for career

progression and rights to health and safety and trade union recognition.

**3. Coordination and coherence:**The current policy

is characterised by short-termism and uncertainty

that is hampering progress. Stimulating demand

for jobs and training requires a long-term strategic

approach in areas such as low-carbon sector

incentives and procurement policies.

**4. Communication and engagement strategy:**

Partnerships across civil society at national and

local level are needed to promote training, job opportunities and inclusiveness.

### 5. A just transition: Workers and communities must

be consulted about the opportunities and threats

to employment in each sector of the economy.

Provision to retrain and upskill in good time must

be built into all jobs and sectors at risk from a

transition to a low-carbon economy.

A National Open College Network (NOCN) report in

2018 (hocon.org.uk/productivity-report ) highlighted

the need to address skills across all sectors with a

focus on:

* management skills to enable identifying

potential and being confident in pushing forward

performance improvements and digital changes
* employability and generic skills, particularly

addressing literacy, numeracy, digital and

cognitive skills
* technical skills and knowledge, particularly

to support the transition to an AI- and

digital-based economy.

Advances in digital and AI will fundamentally change

jobs in many sectors. There are predictions that up

to 35 per cent of jobs will be affected in the coming

decade. Underpinning this are poor levels of literacy

and numeracy. The UK government's industrial

strategy notes that "**within** two decades, 90 per cent

**of jobs will require some digital pro ciency, yet 23 per cent of adults lack basic digital skills."**

Yet a major weakness of this report is the failure to

reference climate change and the importance of

low-carbon skills.

Sklils gaps

Technological change, globalisation, ageing populations and climate change will dramatically increase the pace of change in labour market and skills needs for new and current jobs alike. The growing importance of sustainable development and the shift to a low-carbon economy will also require new skills and qualifications, offering great potential for the creation of green jobs, but also implying structural change and transformation of existing jobs.

Today, skills gaps are already recognised as a major bottleneck in sectors, such as renewable energy, energy and resource efficiency, renovation of buildings, construction, environmental services and manufacturing. The adoption and dissemination of clean technologies requires skills in technology application, adaptation and maintenance. Skills are also crucial for economies and businesses, workers and entrepreneurs, to rapidly adapt to changes as a consequence of environmental policies or climate change.

The International Labour Conference of June 2008 stated that skills development should form part of an effective response to changing conditions with climate change among those. Identifying skills requirements for adaptation to climate change and mitigation measures via reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has therefore an important role to play in policy development. Meeting skills needs is a critical factor for productivity, employment growth and development.

At EU level, the need to shift towards resource-efficient and low-carbon economies has been identified in the EU 2020 strategy and the 2020 climate and energy package, and reaffirmed by the 2020 climate and energy framework. The transition offers significant opportunities for job growth and simultaneous emergence of new occupations, job profiles and therefore skills. The 2016 New Skills Agenda for Europe of the European Commission identified the development of green jobs and of green skills as a priority that can be served by its 10 key actions.

The European Centre for Vocational training (Cedefop) and ILO joined forces and produced a report Skills for Green Jobs: a global view1). The research was based on 21 country studies with a primary focus on good practice examples of how national policies for greening economies are complemented by identification of skills needs and efficient skills response strategies. Cedefop covered country studies in six EU member states: Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Spain and the UK. For further information on international standards see 'Appendix 2: International agreements related to skills policy'. The Aldersgate Group's Time to Deliver report from 2019 noted a "Lack of demand for training to develop skills required in a net-zero economy; a lack of diversity, especially in emerging sectors; and an insu cient pipeline of necessary skills and educational barriers. As most sectors of the economy will be exposed to these risks, government needs to build a solid understanding of the role of di erent sectors in delivering net-zero, the skills required to enable this and their regional distribution." aldersgategroup.org.uk/asset/1578

The Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment (lemma) research also identified the following significant skills gaps:

* Skills to compete. Only 13 per cent of companies are fully confident that they have the skills to successfully compete in a sustainable economy.
* Leadership gap. Only 25 per cent of business leaders, and 20 per cent of senior managers, are fully capable of addressing the sustainability agenda.
* Funding gap. In 72 per cent of organisations, investment in environment and sustainability skills is less than other disciplines, with 63 per cent of organisations spending less than Etoo per head on environment and sustainability training each year.
* Strategic challenge. 65 per cent have not carried out a strategic evaluation of skills needed to successfully compete in a sustainable economy.
* Recruitment gap. Over half (53 per cent) of organisations are unable to recruit environment and sustainability professionals with the right skills.

### Student organisations campaigning on green skills

The National Union of Students (NUS) has published research showing that over 66 per cent of students believe that sustainable development should be incorporated into all university courses. Students Organising for Sustainability (SOS-UK) developed from the work of the NUS and seeks to get more students leading and learning about sustainability. They have developed programmes like Responsible Futures for the FHE sector which wants "all graduates to have the knowledge and understanding, skills and attributes needed to contribute positively to social responsibility and sustainability. Geographers, engineers and artists. Nurses, hairdressers and lawyers. Bricklayers, sociologists and politicians. Everyorietbs:/sustainability.nus.org.uk/responsible-futures"A programme of vocational training through the development of national centres of excellence to promote the reskilling of the workforce in line with the green skills requirements of industrial strategy."

## Appendiceships

At TUC Congress 2019, one motion stated:

"Congress notes its concern that the drive to grow apprenticeships has too o en been at the expense of quality and genuine job creation. The central importance of education within apprenticeship programmes is not recognised. Apprenticeships are not just about training for tasks or for speci c job roles; they should include a broad education which prepares people for the changing world of work and empowers them to be engaged, adaptable and resilient."

Apprenticeship policy has failed badly in recent years. Historically, unions have played an important role in apprenticeship policy and apprenticeships are considered to be one of the cornerstones of dealing with the skills deficit in the economy. However, the new Institute for Apprenticeships has no union representation on the board. There are six employers and two college employers.

An apprenticeship charter has been developed by unionlearn to help employers and other organisations working with unions, to commit to delivering and offering high-quality apprenticeships.

Scotland: development of a climate emergency skills action plan

The Scottish Government has produced a Future Skills Action plan to support Scotland's acquire the necessary skills to address issues such as EU exit, rapid technological changes and the climate emergency.

This plan aims to ensure that Scotland has a skilled and productive workforce which is resilient to future economic challenges and highlights action to increase upskilling and retraining opportunities.

One of the plans key actions involves publishing a climate emergency skills action plan to provide the framework for the skills investment needed to meet the global climate change challenge.

The development of a climate emergency skills action plan is seen to be an important factor in delivering a just transition for Scotland.

This action plan should include an assessment of workforces most likely to be affected by the transition (including those indirectly affected through supply chains), and the most immediate and pressing skills requirements needed to support the net-zero transition. It will need to identify skills for which demand can be expected to increase or decrease, and set out how these will be managed by the skills system in Scotland.

### Regional skills policy

The devolution of the skills budget puts a greater focus on regional authorities to match up skills with industrial strategy. Many of these authorities are also declaring climate emergencies and net-zero targets. Unions will need to review these strategies to ensure that skills development is fully integrated into the action plans.

### Examples of regional strategies

#### Greater London Authority

In 2018, the Greater London Authority (GLA) issued the Skills for Londonstrategy.

There are three key priorities at the heart of the strategy:

1. Empower all Londoners to access the education and skills to participate in society and progress in education and work.
2. Meet the needs of London's economy and employers now and in the future.
3. Deliver a strategic city-wide technical skills and adult education offer.

The strategy contains no reference to climate change and the transition to a zero-carbon economy. It also fails to cross-reference the GLA Environment Strategy. Unions have raised these concerns and called for the establishment of a Just Transition Commission to provide a forum for consultation.

### Liverpool

Extract from the vision statement from Liverpool City Region's Skills Strategy 2018-2023:

"An outstanding and e active skills system that meets the needs of employers, individuals of all ages and communities and drives high aspirations and attainment, to create a truly global and competitive city region at the heart of the Northern Powerhouse."

Unions only get mentioned on the final page of the strategy under the heading 'Implementing Our Strategy':

"The operation of Skills Strategy will be de ned through the production of an improvement plan, with LEP and ESB, focusing on the delivery of the key outcomes. These will be shared with sector groups (linked to the Skills for Growth Agreements), providers, schools, unions and other stakeholders to develop speci c activities that deliver the high-level actions set out in this strategy."Steve Rotheram, Metro Mayor of the Liverpool City

Region, said:

Any skills strategy must address the range of green

"The challenge of becoming a zero-carbon city region skills required. There are two broad categories:

by 2040 is not an easy one. It involves substantial

changes to how we generate and consume energy,

General green skills

and to our infrastructure and transport networks.

By every worker and prospective worker needs a general

But the bene ts are far reaching for everyone who

lives and works in the city region and for generations

impact both their job and wider society.

Aldersgate's Time to Deliver report calls for

a national low-carbon skills strategy, which

integrates sustainability at all levels of the

educational system - in the national curriculum,

apprenticeship programmes, higher education and

particularly through lifelong learning. This will ensure

the UK has an attractive pipeline of skilled workers

for new and growing industries in the long run. More

widely, everyone entering the workforce, irrespective

of their sector, should be equipped with skills for the

low-carbon economy and basic net-zero literacy, as

all job roles will require this knowledge to ensure the

step change needed by employers to get to net-zero."

The TUC's report Powering Aheadmpares what

is happening in Denmark and Germany with the UK

and calls for a "sustainable industrial strategy should

seek to build a consensus across political parties,

business organisations and trade unions"d sets

out recommendations for the sustainable growth of

the renewable energy sector.

students groups and education trades unions has

called for "a government commissioned review into

UNITE'S GREEN SKILLS TRAINING OFFERS FOOD FOR THEUGHIT

Unite is rolling out a

multi-stranded education

programme to equip

its reps with the skills

to negotiate with their

employers on all aspects of

the climate emergency.

The programme includes a

new ve-day environmental

reps course; tailor-made

training for Unite's

industrial sectors; and

a one-day seminar the

union will be delivering in

its regions.

Managing a just transition

to a zero-carbon economy

industries that are most

carbon-intensive, including

agriculture, chemicals,

energy, food, paper

and transport.

The new ve-day

"Congress calls on the General Council to lobby the UK parliament and devolved legislatures to include in the secondary curriculum speci c education on the history of trade unionism and collectivism, workplace rights and the current role and operations of trade unions today.'

### Speci c green skills

Existing jobs will need to be assessed in order to determine any new skills requirements to ensure they are 'climate-proofed'. In some cases, this may just be minor adjustments whereas in others it could be learning a new skills set. Sector plans must take a strategic long-term approach in order to ensure that the supply of workers with the necessary range of green skills is available to meet the demand generated by the requirements of a rapid decarbonisation programme.

### Planting trees needs people with skills

In the 2020 budget, the government committed to plant around 30,000 hectares of trees and restore 35,000 hectares of peatland. However, at the moment there is no skilled workforce capable of delivering it. This o ers an opportunity for workers interested in arboriculture or countryside management to develop skills in this area.

## The reality

At a time when they should be on the increase, the number of green jobs in the UK dropped from 235,900 in 2014 to 224,800 in 2018, according to ONS statistics. This represents a loss of around five per cent. In order for the potential to be realised a comprehensive, interventionist government-led industrial strategy is required. www.tuc.org.uk/news/new- gures-show-dreadful-record-creation-green-jobs-says-tuc

Some sectors of employment will experience a drop in employment rates while others have the potential for significant growth. The level of job creation required to decarbonise at scale is potentially huge. The Campaign Against Climate Change's report **One Million Climate** Joulesk it down as follows:

\begin{tabular}{l l} Electricity & 400,000 \\ \hline Transport & 300,000 \\ \hline Buildings & 185,000 \\ \hline Industry & 25,000 \\ \hline Education & 35,000 \\ \hline Agriculture, waste and forestry & 45,000 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

In 2020, the National Grid called for the creation of 120,000 jobs in the energy sector by 2030 to meet targets. theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/28/uk-must-create-120000-green-energy-jobs-by-2030-to-meet-targets-national-gridA skills shortage emerged following the introduction of strong energy efficiency standards and rapid innovation. Employers and unions jointly assessed training needs and developed training programmes, which government agencies then implemented.

The Aldersgate Group has called for a strategic approach to direct low-carbon investment to regions in need of opportunities and with transferable skill sets. This will require identifying parts of the low-carbon economy where the UK is particularly well-placed to grow its supply chains and in which geographic areas these jobs are likely to be created. This should be mapped against how sectoral transition pathways are likely to impact on employment, with plans made accordingly to support the growth of new industries with similar skill sets as declining industries in the same parts of the country. Each sector of the economy will require a strategic approach based on how it fits in to the overall plan for decarbonisation of the economy. There are already examples of this transition, with over one-third of marine engineers working in offshore renewables transitioning from the oil and gas sector. More details of transferable skills in this sector can be found in Appendix 4.

Workers will need support to transition to different jobs.

The initiative is typical of the joined-up approach to greening the construction industry that the GSP has developed since its launch nine years ago. The GSP was originally inspired by the San Francisco-based Apollo Alliance, a coalition of unions, business, environmental and community groups set up in 2003 to promote the low-carbon economy. It was launched by unionlearn in 2011 - coincidentally the same year that Apollo became part of the larger, Minneapolis-based BlueGreen Alliance of Union's Environmental Organisations. The original brief was to bring together a set of stakeholders that could operate work experience opportunities, placements, apprenticeships and local jobs in construction, retro t, horticulture and waste management projects, rst in London and then across the south-east. Stuart Barber, who is now head of operations and strategy for the GSP, has been involved in the partnership from the very beginning: he was working for unionlearn at the time of its launch, when the projects have put thousands of tonnes into the waste stream every year has been a bugbear of Steve's over the years," Stuart explains. "It was his idea that we could do something about it, so we put together a thinkank, came up with Think Global Act Local and put that under the badge of the GSP." The green ambassadors, who will be central to the success of the scheme, are themselves very much inspired by the trade union movement's green reps and union learning reps (ULRs). "We're targeting the green ambassador training at young people that the construction companies pay us to train and then they go out into their local communities and help spread the word about upcycling the surplus materials," explains Stuart. "By getting the materials into the hands of local small businesses, we can help make the di erence between them going under and staying afloat because we can reduce their overheads by supplying them with xures and ttings they don't have to go and buy."
