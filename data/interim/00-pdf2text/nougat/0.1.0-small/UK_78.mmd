## Foreword

The Environmental Justice Commission was established in May 2019 in recognition that action to address the accelerating climate and nature emergencies can be about more than staving o the worst; it can be about imagining a better world which we can build together. A future where people and nature can thrive, with resilient local communities, good jobs, successful low-carbon businesses, and where inequalities are reduced and opportunities o erect to all. A future where progress is measured by the quality of life, security and wellbeing of all citizens as well as the health of our natural world.

To realise this vision will require a new approach which understands the inextricable link between addressing the climate and nature crises with the necessary speed and ambition, and simultaneously tackling economic and social injustice. The transformation must be rooted in fairness - not only because the poorest communities are least responsible for these crises and invariably the worst a acted, but because unless action to restore nature and decarbonise the economy is rooted in social and economic justice, it simply won't succeed.

We are proud to be co-chairs of this important commission that not only proposes ambitious policies to achieve net zero as soon as possible, but also examines the obstacles to a successful transition and identi es measures to overcome them. We recognise that the public has a veto - their concerns must be addressed, and their consent won. If the transition is managed poorly, or not managed at all, then it could threaten to make people's lives harder, including those who are already losing out from the current economic system. We cannot make changes that further embed unfairness in our society; on the contrary, this is an opportunity to put fairness at the centre of all we do.

A successful transition means that people must be at the heart of the policy making process, and those most a acted by change must be the ones to shape it. This approach not only builds deeper and broader public support which can endure short-term political cycles but also, as this report shows, deliver better and fairer outcomes too.

We have therefore put people at the centre not just of our recommendations, but also our approach to developing them. Since 2019, we have held deliberative workshops, listening exercises and citizens' juries around the UK with people from many di erent walks of life. Despite the pandemic, we have worked with citizens in Doncaster, Tees Valley and County Durham, London, the South Wales Valleys, Thurrock and Aberdeenshire. These communities were chosen precisely because they are likely to face di erent challenges as a consequence of the transition to net zero.

Throughout our work, we have also been able to engage with and hear from community groups, workers and their trade unions, businesses, civil society, and national and local politicians. We have spoken to policymakers from around the world, learning lessons - both from what has worked and what hasn't - from transitions in other countries. The learning from these many conversations are distilled in this report.

This is a profound moment of change. The e ects of Covid-19 have brought into sharp relief the government's prime responsibility to keep the public safe from the major shocks, challenges and threats to our society. It has also reminded us of the scale and speed at which governments can act when the true nature of an emergency is recognised.

The threats posed by the climate and nature emergencies are orders of magnitude greater than even the worst that we have witnessed throughout these past grim months. If the pandemic has reminded us that far-reaching change to how our economies work is possible, history shows that we have been able to respond to crises by redesigning the economy, as we did in the a termath of the second world war.

This  nal report of the Environmental Justice Commission argues for a similarly ambitious approach - one that can secure a cleaner, greener economy, and that is fairer and improves wellbeing too, restoring the health of people and the natural world. It o ers a plan that is optimistic and practical, both honest about the challenges we face and committed to seizing this moment to improve lives and o er opportunities for all, ensuring - crucially - that no-one is le t behind.

This summary, and the longer full report of the commission, have been shaped by the views, wisdom and recommendations of the people we have engaged with across the UK over the past two years. We are immensely grateful to them all.

## Introduction

This summary of the  nal report of the Environmental Justice Commission sets out a vision for the future of the UK.

Part one de nes the shi is needed in the UK's approach to addressing the climate and nature crises and makes the case for a 'new social contract', to deliver a transition that is both rapid and fair.

Part two, in  ve chapters, outlines the practical steps we propose. Each contains proposals on what we think needs to be done, when and by whom.

The commission's recommendations have been shaped by the experience, insights, and priorities of the jurors of our four citizens' juries held across the UK in 2020-21.

This summary document presents the central proposals of our  nal report. The full set of recommendations and the detailed evidence to support them are set out in the accompanying evidence report. 1

Listening to the Public

Beginning in 2019, the Environmental Justice Commission has held deliberative workshops, listening exercises and citizens' juries around the UK. From managing extreme weather events to transitioning away from high-polluting industries, we heard from communities across the UK facing signi cant challenges.

Tees Valley and County Durham is home to 60 per cent of the UK's energy-intensive industry (Tennison 2017) and generates carbon emissions three times higher than the UK average (O'Brien et al 2017). It faces signi cant risks if the transition is badly managed, but could bene t from jobs created in low-carbon industries. There's also potential to develop its substantial natural assets as a carbon sink.

"Even when people don't necessarily come from the same background and beliefs, we have similar thoughts about the importance of positive action and trying to change for the better."

Juror from the Tees Valley and County Durham citizens' jury 2

Footnote 2: All quote s are drawn from the reports of the citizens juries held by IPPR (IPPR 2021a, 2021b, 2021c, 2021d) or directly from the recordings of the juries themselves.

In the South Wales Valleys there are lessons to learn from the area's poorly managed industrial transitions of the past.

Investment and government action are needed to move away from high carbon industries and harness 'the green lungs for the region' (MacBride-Stewart 2020), the rich green landscape of the valleys.

"It doesn't matter how knowledgeable you are about

the subject beforehand, you can still contribute

[to the citizens' jury] and you will be listened to."

Juror from the South Wales Valleys citizens' juryThurrock, by contrast, sits on the Thames estuary 20 miles east of central London and is part of Essex's commuter belt. Thurrock's economy is tied to its three international ports and the area acts as the industrial gateway to the South East. Consequently, carbon emissions from transport in the region are two thirds higher than the national average (Transport East 2020). As well as being key to the economy, the estuary is also the focal point of Thurrock's natural assets, and active management and restoration of its salt marshes could sequester carbon and provide much needed - good protection (La oley and Grimsditch 2009).

Aberdeenshire is the 'oil capital of Europe', and Aberdeen has become central to discussions about the 'just transition' for workers in carbon intensive industries. More than 10 per cent of total employment in Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire is currently in the oil and gas industry (over 24,000 jobs in total) (Emden, Murphy and Gunson 2020). Yet, across the UK, decommissioning oil and gas rigs, increasing wind power, carbon capture and storage and producing low-carbon hydrogen, could create around 275,000 jobs (ibid). Much of the infrastructure - such as pipe networks, port infrastructure and storage sites - and, crucially, skills and experience needed for these jobs can be found in the oil and gas sector already, giving workers a crucial role to play in the transition. There is also more to Aberdeenshire than oil and gas. With native pinewoods, bogs, sand dunes, mountains and coast, this diverse landscape is also home to over a quarter of Scotland's arable farming areas (Aberdeenshire Council 2017).

Jobs in Doncaster and Yorkshire and the Humber, where we held a citizen workshop, are disproportionately reliant on carbon intensive industries, and South Yorkshire is regularly subject to major - coding.

These very di erent communities across the UK all recognised the extent of the challenges ahead, but each one provided optimistic, ambitious proposals for action, shaped by the unique characteristics of their areas.

From the opening sessions of our - rst citizens' jury in Tees Valley and County Durham in October 2020 through to the closing minutes in Aberdeenshire in March 2021, we have been overwhelmed by the good humour, openness and interest shown by every juror who took part. We have worked with 84 jurors over 1,600 combined hours of deliberation and developed over 100 recommendations. It has been a privilege to get to know the jurors and learn about their communities, their anxieties and their hopes for the future. 3

## Chapter 1 The Case for Change -

The Six Shifts

Listening to people's experiences and aspirations, we have heard about the many challenges that the UK faces and the anxieties of the people who face them, but we have also heard about the numerous opportunities that could be realised as the country enters this decade of profound change.

Drawn from the insights of jurors from our citizens' juries across the UK, in this chapter we set out the six major shi ts that are needed in the UK's approach to addressing the climate and nature crises if we are to maximise and fairly share the bene ts and opportunities of the transition, minimise and share the burdens of the risks, and move at the pace that these crises demand.

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & From a problem to be mitigated \\  & to enjoy everything to be sized \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & "There is an untapped treasure in the Valleys...There is a \\  & sleeping dragon here waiting to breathe & re into a recovery \\  & which will help the planet as well as the UK." \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & Junor from the South Wales Valleys citizens' jury \\ \end{tabular}

Despite the scale of the climate and nature crises - and the impacts, from ooding to extreme heatwaves, which are already with us - the UK must view these challenges not just as a problem to be mitigated, but an opportunity to be seized. The bene ts of ambitious action are substantial for both the public and the environment - from the creation of decent jobs, to lower energy bills and signi cant public health bene ts, to burgeoning wildlife and a healthier planet.

All of the communities we spoke with across the UK recognised the challenges of the transition but also pointed to the huge potential of fully drawing upon the assets, skills and talent that lie in their communities.

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & "We have huge assets - from our local industry to the skills, talent \\  & and expertise of all who live in Aberdeenshire. There is a huge \\  & opportunity to build on these strengths, but we need a vision \\  & and a strategy to maximise them." \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & Aberdeenshire citizens' jury \\ \end{tabular}

Our existing economic system is driving both environmental damage and deep economic and social unfairness (IPPR 2020). In transforming our economy to deliver better outcomes for the environment we can, and must, also improve the quality of life for everyone.

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & From fairness as an effectiveint \\  & to fairness as a foundation \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & "No one can be left out. A fair response to the climate and nature \\  & emergencies needs to increase equality in society." \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & Tees Valley and County Durham citizens' jury \\ \end{tabular}

The debate about whether we transition to a clean economy is largely resolved but the debate over how we transition has only just begun. The central question to that debate is how it can be done in a way that is fair - in the words of Chris Stark, head of the Climate Change Committee, it is 'almost the only question' (Garman 2021). This is because, as we have seen with the 'glies jaunes' protests in France, delivering the transition in a fair way is crucial to securing legitimacy for and e cacy of the transition and building enduring public and political support.

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & "We need to make sure that all decisions that are made are fair at the \\  & point of decision making and throughout their implementation." \\ \end{tabular}

This message was reinforced over and over again by the people we spoke to and has been supported by the ndings of similar processes such as the UK Climate Assembly.4

Footnote 4: See: [https://www.climateassembly.uk](https://www.climateassembly.uk).

This is about more than just avoiding unfairness arising in the transition itself. It's also about addressing existing unfairness across our economy and society. The aspects of fairness that the people we spoke to were anxious to have addressed were the following.

* The distribution of c osts for individuals, businesses and the public purse. This includes taxation, everyday expenses like energy bills, as well as the price of purchasing sustainable food, and the cost of low-carbon goods and services such as energy e ciency retro ts.
* "Action should not be regressive and make life harder for people already struggling. People should be supported to make the changes they need to."
* Aberdeenshire citizens' jury
* The questions of fairness both within and between di erent places across the UK. This relates particularly to the distribution of economic investment, the impacts on new and existing jobs, and to who is most a acted by the impacts of the climate and nature crises.
* "We believe that the future should be inclusive and we recognise that those [places] who have been historically left behind may need additional support to prosper." South Wales Valleys citizens' jury
* Aspects of fairness relating to gender, race and disability. Jurors were conscious that some people, already disadvantaged by our current economic system, are being impacted disproportionately by the environmental crises and are at risk from badly managed policy responses too, as was underlined in our interim report (IPPR 2020).
* "Inequality is a big issue." Juror from the Thurrock citizens' jury
* Fairness for younger and future generations. Our jurors were acutely aware of the greater impact that the climate and nature crises will have on younger and future generations and wanted to ensure this was re acted in decision making.
* "I guess it's not going to have much of an effect on me. But l've got children and grandchildren and it is those who are going to be affected." Juror from the Tees Valley and County Durham citizens' jury
* Fairness internationally, recognising the varying responsibilities, historic contribution and capabilities amongst di erent countries across the world. Those we spoke with saw the global role and cumulative contribution of the UK to the climate and nature crises and the need for greater responsibly for addressing the problem, as well as the economic bene ts that the UK could accrue in taking a leadership role (Webb et al 2021).
* "We need to take the rest of the world with us. If you lead the world then business will follow and that will attract investment. If we can build technologies that can be exported, this can create jobs." Juror from the Thurrock citizens' jury 
\begin{tabular}{c} "People need to feel that they are part of the change. \\ We need to bring people with us and for it not to feel like \\ we are having things done to us." \\ South Wales Valleys citizens' jury \\ \end{tabular}

Moving from an approach that is centralised and remote, to one owned and importantly informed by the public, will be crucial to a successful transition. People are experts in their own lives and aspirations. They have experiences and knowledge which are hugely valuable in designing better policy.

In addition, the transition is now moving from being conducted 'in the background' - through the way we generate electricity, for example - to one that will have a noticeable impact on people's everyday lives: people changing the boiler in their home, changing their car, switching to public transport, or re-training for a new job. If government is to secure enduring public support, then it needs to take people with it on this journey.

\begin{tabular}{c} "My concern throughout is that everything seems to lead back \\ to individuals doing their bit, which is important, but change \\ needs to start on a much wider scale than that." \\ Juror from the Thurrock citizens' jury \\ \end{tabular}

The climate and nature crises require collective, systemic and interrelated action. Addressing them also needs system wide coordination, not leaving the public to do all of the heavy li ring.

Too o ten greater emphasis is put on what individuals must do than on creating the context that makes it easier for people to make the right choice for them and the environment. As our jurors argued, while we all have a role to play, we have to work together to change our systems too. People want a partnership between government, business, workers, civil society and the public. Every part of the economy and society must be involved in the transition if it is to be a success.

\begin{tabular}{c} "We need a joined-up, collaborative approach if \\ we are to see the scale of change required." \\ Tees Valley and County Durham citizens' jury \\ \end{tabular}

However, far from coordinating change across society, too o ten government fails to work e actively even with itself. Whether at a national, regional or local level, government too o ten acts in siloes. Likewise, environmental, economic and social policies are o ten seen as separate and distinct, having little to do with each other. For example, the UK cannot credibly commit to delivering net zero and restoring nature, and then proceed to support or allow decisions such as building new deep coal mines which will increase global carbon emissions (Deben 2021).

From co-down alone to national leadership with local ownership and delivery

"Local areas need to create their own plans and priorities based on their local assets. They will need the resources to see these plans through."

Tees Valley and County Durham citizens' jury

People want strong leadership from government and see that it can play a powerful role in coordinating a national e ort but it must be designed around empowered localities who own and deliver the tailored solutions.

The response to Covid-19 has shown the power of government and what can be achieved, if the political will is there. That does not mean, however, that the answer is a purely top-down approach. Di erent areas of the UK have di erent challenges, assets and opportunities, so a 'one size ts all policy' won't secure a transition that is either fair or e active. By contrast, designing policies with local circumstances in mind, through passing powers down to local communities, can help achieve better and fairer outcomes (Raikes 2020).

"Nature and the local wildlife kind of brings communities together for us all really, even though we live in very different areas throughout Wales."

Juror from the South Wales Valleys citizens' jury

The need to address the climate crisis increasingly, and rightly, occupies time within political and policy debates. Yet the nature crisis is o ten treated as its 'poorer cousin', receiving signi cantly less attention and therefore fewer policy commitments, targets and less investment (Laybourn et al 2019). This matters for two principal reasons.

Firstly, the nature crisis is both of equal importance and intimately linked to the climate challenge. The UK is one of the most nature depleted countries in the world (Hayhow et al 2016). Our destruction of nature actively accelerates global heating, but its repair can help to address it (Laybourn et al 2019). If we are to achieve net zero without su ciently addressing our wider impact on nature, the consequences for our economy and society would still be profound.

Secondly, the great importance that people place on nature and access to green space is not re acted in our national conversation. The jurors want to put nature right at the heart of all climate policy and beyond.

2.

A NEW SOCIAL CONTRACT

Drawing on recommendations from the jurors, we believe that now is the time for a new'social contract for a fair transition'. The contract contains six principles, each of which responds to a shi t.

The six shifts...

... a new social contract

From a problem to be mitigated to an opportunity to be seized

From fairness as an afterthought to fairness as a foundation

From being done to people to being done with and by them

From top-down to national leadership and local delivery

From individuals and silos to a whole-economy and all-society approach

From climate and nature alone to climate

From climate and nature together

Volume what mattersIf we are to seize the opportunities of the transition then all people and communities across the UK must bene t, with the greatest return accruing to those who need it most. This is what we call the 'people's dividend'.

"There should be more community ownership of local assets, so that citizens have more control over and a greater stake in the decisions that affect them."

Tees Valleys and County Durham citizens' jury

The 'people's dividend' should include the following.

* for example, free local decarbonised public transport.
* for example, revenue raised through carbon pricing or payments for household contributions to the energy grid.
* for example, community-owned energy and nature assets.
* for example, a funded 'right to retrain' for those transitioning from high-carbon industries.
* for example, transforming neighbourhoods into greener, more social spaces.

The transition the UK is making must be fair. Our jurors provided a clear sense of what a 'fairness lock' for climate and nature policies could look like. This lock should move beyond a simple 'cost of living test' to one that is more re active of the di erent costs and bene ts that come with the transition.

"The cost of change - both nancial and in how we live - has to be shared fairly."

South Wales Valleys citizens' jury

A fairness lock should guarantee the following.

* people are fully involved in decision making, including those who are most disadvantaged.
* including carbon pricing that protects those on the lowest incomes.
* places and communities particularly impacted across the UK
- no place will be let t behind
- di erent people and communities including by income, age, gender, race and disability
- younger and future generations.
Help is put in pl ace ahead of change to allay anxieties and maintain public support - for example, households have the means to transition to low-carbon heating systems before regulations come into place. That the UK makes a fair contribution internationally - the UK recognises that there are varying responsibilities and capabilities to respond amongst di erent countries across the world.

The public want to be part of this transition. They want change brought about with or by them - not done to them.

"The area needs the input of local people with on the ground experience to share with those who have responsibility to make things happen."

Juror from the Thurrock citizens' jury

A people rst approach must ensure the following.

Clear, accessible information about the transition is available to the public - including a public communications plan and 'one stop shops' for support. The public have a clear role in the creation of plans - including through a permanent, national citizens' assembly for climate and nature deliberation and a leading role in local plans too.

Local communities have greater ownership over the decisions that a ect them - including a nationwide commitment to participatory budgeting.

Our jurors were clear that we need national leadership and a strategy to deliver the change needed.

"Action must re ect the urgency of the situation.We need to act now. Leadership has to be shown by government, but everyone is accountable for taking action and should feel part of making the changes that are required."

Aberdeenshire citizens' jury

However, the impacts of the transition will be di erent in di erent places. Communities, and their local leaders, have a better understanding of their local areas - the challenges, the assets and the opportunities - and they must be able to shape and deliver their own response.

"Local people need to be empowered to act. Every area is unique

and a 'one size ts all' approach isn't going to work."

The Tees Valleys and County Durham citizens' jury

In practice this means the following.

* The UK government and devolved nations show leadership by developing plans and making investments to manage the transition, but devolving as many powers and resources as is possible.
* Local areas and communities are able to shape and deliver their own response through consistent, long-term, devolution deals.

A whole-economy, all-society approach

Our jurors wanted to see a joined up approach across governments and their departments, and a partnership approach across the whole of the economy and society too.

"Decisions need to be joined up with different organisations working together to make the most of the resources and time we have. We shouldn't be acting in silos."

South Wales Valleys citizens' jury

"We should involve workers and the businesses affected by these regulations in designing and advocating for them."

South Wales Valleys citizens' jury

In practice this means the following.

* including a net zero and nature rule to ensure no public money is spent on projects which make the problem worse.
* with government providing an enabling environment through tax incentives, small business loans and regulation.
* including transition plans in carbon intensive industries, drawn up with workers, and engaging with small businesses.

Our jurors were clear about the high value they place on nature in their lives and the need to protect, invest in and restore it. They had a much broader conception of what a 'better life for all' looks like than the o ten-narrow focus in the national debate on measures such as GDP. To succeed, they believe we must move to a focus on wellbeing, the things that contribute to it, and that matter most to people.

"To bring people with us on this journey we need to see this not as a sacri ce but as a progression to a more sustainable way of life. We need to be positive in our response to these emergencies."

Aberdeenshire citizens' jury

In practice this will mean the following.

* including through the creation of a Nature Recovery Committee and similar legally binding targets for the environment.
* for example nature supports sustainable agriculture, underpins productivity, and supports work-life balance.
* including introducing a Wellbeing of Future Generations Act and embedding the Sustainable Development Goals as the preferred measures of success for all government policy.
WHAT'S NEXT

The recommendations made in this summary, and in our full report, cover areas where the UK government holds reserve powers and areas where responsibility is devolved across the four nations. The vast majority of our recommendations are relevant for the UK government and the devolved nations but in recognition of the di erent policy contexts, proposals will need to be adapted to suit the particular circumstances. 6

Footnote 6: Where costings are presented, they are for the UK government and commensurate funding will be required to support those policies in areas where policy is devolved.

As part of its work, the commission has recognised that action to address the climate and nature crises will necessarily involve change in every sector of the economy. While the commission's work has been wide ranging, we have sought to focus on the priorities expressed by our citizens juries. Issues not covered by this report include the UK's energy mix, aviation and shipping, nevertheless we recognise their importance and the necessity for a fair transition.

The ve chapters that follow apply the six principles of our social contract across our economy and society. More detail on our proposals, and full list of the recommendations, are available in the longer evidence report of the commission.

## Chapter 3 SHARING POWER

### 3.1 The CHANGE WE NEED TO SEE

Responding to the climate and nature crises requires involving and empowering people in decision-making. It will mean sharing power.

People have a veto on all climate and nature policies, which they can exercise at the ballot box. Through greater public involvement in decision making, policies and plans will garner wider and more enduring public support, and be fairer in both perception and practice.

We can and must revitalise UK democracy, ensuring people feel part of the change, have a renewed sense of ownership over the actions taken, and are actively involved in improving their local communities, with the bene ts widely shared.

"If a small amount of strangers can come together and discuss this topic and make suggestions and ideas to improve our future, imagine what a whole community can achieve."

Juror from the Aberdeenshire citizens'jury.

breatches. These targets could be established through the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act (see above) or the government's Environment Bill. The devolved nations each have their own net zero targets and these measures would need to be adopted by them in the same fashion.
* To keep 1.5\({}^{\circ}\)C degrees of warming in reach and halt the decline of nature, the UK government, devolved nations, local government and all public bodies, including the UK Infrastructure Bank, should adopt a new 'net zero and protection of nature' rule and apply this to all investment decisions. Within central government, such a test would apply to the budget and comprehensive spending reviews. It would strengthen existing guidance on assessing greenhouse gas emissions within the Green Book by ensuring all spending decisions, across all government departments, contribute to meeting legally-binding environmental targets. 11

Footnote 11: WMF UK outlined the design of a 'net zero test’ within their response to the Comprehensive Spending Review (WWV UK 2020) with the same principles being equally relevant to the protection of nature.

12 The framework for devolved powers and the funding settlements required to support this is de ned in Webb (2020) and further detail on the powers to be devoted is available in the evidence report of the commission.

13 This could be partly achieved through a new 'right to invest' that ensures community’s at least a 20% stake in all onshore windarms, as per Denmark’s 2009 'Promotion of Renewable Energy Act.

14 Our proposal sits between the amounts allocated to Big Local and Power to Change (E150 million) and the proposal for up to _ES_ billion for a Community Wealth Fund argued for by the Alliance for a Community Wealth Fund Alliance (Local Trust 2018). Similar funds should be created in the devolved nations.

## Supporting Local Action

"Local areas need to create their own plans and priorities based on their local assets. They will need the resources to see these plans through."

Tees Valley and County Durham citizens' jury

* All policy must be t ailored to the di erent needs of local communities, therefore all local areas should be o ered the powers and resources to play their part in achieving net zero and support nature to recover as part of a new devolution framework. 12 The UK is one of the most centralised nations in the developed world despite signi cant evidence that more devolved economies deliver better outcomes (Raikes 2020). English combined and local authorities must be given new powers over economic strategy, public services (such as skills and welfare), taxation, transport and spatial planning.
* To empower communities to actively take part in the transition, the UK government should aim to signi cantly increase the proportion of community-owned low-carbon assets. As part of this, one third of new onshore renewables in England, such as wind turbines and solar panels, should be under community ownership by 2030. 13 In addition, the existing Community Right to Bid, within the Localism Act, should be extended to cover a larger de nition of community value and support communities to buy or lease unused or underused local assets from both the public sector and private investors. All community-owned projects must also adopt high-quality work standards in consultation with unions. As part of delivering this target the UK government should create a single new, independent and permanent Thriving Places Fund for England that is endowed by the government, and the National Lottery, with at least E1.5 billion over the next three years. 14

Footnote 12: The framework for devolved powers and the funding settlements required to support this is de ned in Webb (2020) and further detail on the powers to be devoted is available in the evidence report of the commission.

14 This could be partly achieved through a new 'right to invest' that ensures community’s at least a 20% stake in all onshore windarms, as per Denmark’s 2009 'Promotion of Renewable Energy Act.

Footnote 14: Our proposal sits between the amounts allocated to Big Local and Power to Change (E150 million) and the proposal for up to _ES_ billion for a Community Wealth Fund argued for by the Alliance for a Community Wealth Fund Alliance (Local Trust 2018). Similar funds should be created in the devolved nations.

4. TRANSFFORMING

OUR ECONOMY

THE CHANGE WE NEED TO SEE

For a fair transition to succeed, the UK must transform its economy to better serve society and the planet we live on. Through this transformation we can create high-quality jobs, improve wellbeing and 'level up' to narrow regional inequalities. Analysis by IPPR shows that the transition could create 1.7 million jobs by 2035 in sectors from transport to home retro t and low-carbon electricity.

Our jurors were clear that we need national leadership to set the ambition and drive the change needed. They were also clear that the state cannot deliver this alone. A new partnership between the state and business is needed. This means providing the incentives for businesses, particularly SMEs, to act and applying penalties and regulation for those that don't.

Our jurors also want a partnership with workers and their trade unions. Government at all levels must focus on the education, training and skills needs of workers of all ages, at all points in life. This must include support for workers in carbon intensive industries - up to 3.2 million jobs will need reskilling as part of the transition to net zero (Robins et al 2019). The UK needs to equip its workforce with the skills for new and di erent jobs that sustain people and the natural world. Workers must be given a greater voice and stake over their futures, particularly those who will be directly a acted by the transition.

"We need to make it easier for businesses to make these changes and reward them for being proactive in taking action."

## GOVERNMENT LEADERSHIP

"The government leading the way on investments

means that individuals, communities and businesses are

more likely to follow, rather than having to take the risks

themselves of starting something new."

Tees Valley and County Durham citizens' jury

To e actively manage the transition across all sectors of the economy, a Net

Zero and Fair Transition Delivery Body should be established for the UK, and

each of the devolved nations, 15 in order to manage the transition across all

sectors of the economy. Its objective should be to involve stakeholders from

across business, trade unions and workers themselves, local government and

community voices, academia and civil society. The aim of this body should be

to facilitate dialogue between these key stakeholders and government, co-

develop a Net Zero and Fair Transition Delivery Plan with all these stakeholders,

including worker-led 'fair transition agreements', 16 and support the development

of fair transition plans across every sector of the economy, including sectors in

the 'everyday economy' such as retail and wholesale.

"Businesses and investors need to be part of the solution...

They need to be incentivised to act, but there needs to be

penalties if they don't."

Tees Valley and County Durham citizens' juryRainsing investment in net zero and nature

"Action is urgent, and we need to accelerate the pace of change.

We need to increase the scale of investment and for this to

align with the urgency of change required."

Aberdeenshire citizens' jury

To meet the scale of the climate and nature crisis, we call on the UK government to make a minimum public investment of $30 billion on an annual basis up until

at least 2030.17 This should be funded by borrowing, as it is an investment that will deliver ongoing savings in terms of reduced environmental costs, greater tax

revenues (as a result of high employment) and lower public expenditure (due to

lower welfare and public service demand). Funding should be used to accelerate

the path to net zero, to create jobs and 'level up' regions within England and

within the devolved nations, and to help the economy recover and stabilise

public nances a ter Covid-19. 18

Footnote 18: IPPR analysis of investment required to meet net zero across all sectors, of the investment required for

nature restoration and of the funding needed for retraining, skills and education. See evidence report of

the commission for further detail on the breakdown.

To support businesses to decarbonise, the UK government should develop

and deliver the following.

- Zero-interest business loans to support continuing investment into

business energy e ciency and decarbonising energy consumption.

This should form part of the GreenGO scheme outlined in the following

chapter and have a particular focus on SMEs.

- Industrial i energy 'big switches', to reduce high energy costs, that

o er power purchasing agreements (PPAs) to multiple industries and

green energy providers. The agreements would involve the government

aggregating industries interested in participating and then conducting an

auction process among energy suppliers to supply these industries with

renewable-based electricity at a

xed energy price for a number of years.

Carbon pricing 19 has a role to play in making environmentally damaging

behaviours more expensive, and clean activities cheaper through subsidies

but its use must meet a series of fairness tests. Any increase or expansion in

the use of carbon pricing should be introduced incrementally and targeted

at activities with the worst environmental impacts. Support should be in place

before prices rise for households and some businesses to transition, as well as

protections for low-income households and a revenue recycling compensation

scheme (see GreenGO section in chapter 5). It should be used as part of a wider

package of investment and reforms.

"Where there are additional costs, like fossil fuel taxes,

they should be phased in to give people time to prepare and

those on low incomes should be protected."

Thurrock Citizens' Jury

To align their investments with net zero, the Paris Agreement and wider

environmental targets, UK

nancial institutions should be legally required to

set science based interim and long-term targets for net zero and for nature

too. Financial institutions should be obliged to report on their progress and

set out the barriers and reasons for not meeting them and a future pathway for doing so. The Financial Conduct Authority should be empowered to provide an impartial assessment of rms performance against these indicators.
* So that the public c an use their pensions and investments to support the transition, the government should set a legal requirement for the 'default' de ned contribution funds to be net zero aligned by 2030 at the latest and to make it quicker and easier for consumers to switch in the meantime. All nanacial indices should be required to disclose their overall carbon and environmental footprint to investors.

EDUCATION, TRAINING, SKILLS AND WORKER VOICE

"Urgency is needed in the creation of new job opportunities, which must be equitably distributed across the country. This needs to be supported by a clear strategy and monitored over time."

Aberdeenshire citizens' jury

* To protect workers and harness their skills, the UK government and devolved nations should introduce a new funded 'right to retrain' for all workers impacted by the transition to net zero. All workers whose jobs may be a acted by the transition should have a legal right to receive training to set them on a path towards re-employment. Where possible, retraining within the same business should be prioritised.
* including the Scottish government expanding the funding of their own Transition Training Fund. The funding would be distributed by Skills Academies (see below) to businesses applying for training courses on behalf of existing workers and new labour market entrants.
* To provide a route into net-zero compatible employment, Green Skills Academies should be established by the UK government and devolved nations for existing workers, unemployed individuals and new entrants to the labour market. The academies should be partnerships between local authorities and/or combined authorities and further education colleges. These should be funded through the Green Training Fund.

Footnote 21: These proposals go beyond mandatory climate disclosures by requiring targets to be set and plans published on how they can be met.

## 6.4 Other Recommendations

The commission's other recommendations in this area include supporting the circular economy, local economic strategies, additional measures to support business including carbon contracts for di erence, standards, labelling schemes and accreditation marks; green procurement; and carbon border adjustments and import standards, the involvement of workers and trade unions in the process of the transition, skills passports, and education. These, and further information on the recommendations above, can be found in the longer evidence report of the commission.
