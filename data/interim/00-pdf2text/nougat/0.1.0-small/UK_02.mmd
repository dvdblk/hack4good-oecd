## Executive summary

**Artificial intelligence (Hi) is the fastest growing deep technology in the world, with huge potential to rewrite the rules of critic industries, drive substantial economic growth and transform at areas of life. The UK is a global superpower in all and will protect to lead the world over the next decade as a genuine research and innovation opportunities, a huse of global talent and a progressive regulatory and business environment.**

Many of the UK's successes in AI were supported by the 2017 industrial Strategy, which set out the government vision to monitor the UK's global centre for AI movement. In April 2018, the government and the UK's campaign appeared as part of 1 billion AI research Cloud is shown to be the US global position as a ladder in developing AI technologies.

This new National at Strategic fields on the UK's strengths but also represents the same of a step-change for AI in UK's developing the power of AI to increase researchers, productivity, growth and innovation across the private and public sectors.

This is however well prepared in the UK for the next ten years, and is built on three assumptions about the coming decade:

* all of which have higher global competitors.
* A well become mainstream in much of the economy and action will be required to return every sector and region of the UK benefit from this transition.
* Our governance and regulatory regimes will need to keep pace with the fast-changing demands of AI, remaining growth and competition, during its existence in innovation, and protecting the safety, security, choices and rights of our citizens.

The UK National at Strategy therefore aims to:

E172 million of investment through the UKRl into the Hartree National Centre for Digital Innovation, leveraging an additional E38 million of private investment into High Performance Computing. Further investments have been made into the Tech Nation Applied AI programme - now in its third iteration; establishing the Office for National Statistics Data Science Campus; the Crown Commercial Service's public sector AI procurement portal; and support for the Department for International Trade attracting AI related Foreign Direct Investment into the UK. As part of the AI Sector Deal, the government established the AI Council to bring together respected leaders to strengthen the conversation between academia, industry, and the public sector. The Office for Artificial Intelligence was created as a new team within government to take responsibility for overarching AI policy across government and to be a focal point for the AI ecosystem through its secretatiant of the AI Council. The Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDE) was established as a government expert body focused on the trustworthy use of data and AI in the public and private sector. This strategy builds on the recent history of government support for AI and considers the next key steps to harness its potential in the UK for the coming decade. In doing so, the National AI Strategy leads on from the ambitious outlined in the government's Innovation Strategy to enable UK businesses and innovators to respond to economic opportunities and real-world problems through our national innovation process. AI was identified in the Innovation Strategy as one of the seven technology families where the UK has a globally competitive R&D and industrial strength11 and has been widely cited as a set of technologies in which the UK must maintain a leading edge to guarantee our continued security and prosperity in an intensifying geopolitical landscape.

Accessing the right finance at the right time is critical for AI innovators to be able to develop their idea into a commercially viable product and grow their business, but this is complicated by the long timelines often needed for AI research and development work.[30, 31] The AI Council's Roadmap suggests a funding gap at series B+, meaning that AI companies are struggling to scale and stay under UK ownership.

While the UK's funding ecosystem is robust, the government is committed to ensuring the system is easy for businesses and innovators to navigate, and that any existing gaps are addressed. The recent Innovation Strategy signalled the Government's efforts to support innovators by bringing together effective private markets with well-targeted public investment. In it, the government set out plans to upskill leaders to assess risk when lending to innovative businesses and outlined work across Innovate UK and the British Business Bank to investigate how businesses interact with the public support landscape, to maximise accessibility for qualifying businesses. A good example of this is the Future Fund Breakthrough, a new f375 million UK-wide programme launched in July 2021, will encourage private investors to co-invest with the government in high-growth innovative businesses to accelerate the deployment of breakthrough technologies.

Our economy's success and our citizens' safety rely on the government's ability to protect national security while keeping the UK open for business with the rest of the world. Within this context, we will ensure we protect the growth of welcome investment into the UK's AI ecosystem. **The government has introduced the National Security and Investment Act** that will provide new powers to screen investments effectively and efficiently now and into the future. It will give businesses and investors the reassurance that the UK continues to welcome the right talent, investment and collaboration that underpins our wider economic security.

### Trade

AI is a key part of the UK's digital goods and services exports, which totalled 669.3bn in 2019.[32] Trade can support the UK's objectives to sustain the mature, competitive and innovative AI developer base the UK needs to access customers around the world.

As part of its free trade agenda, the government is committed to pursuing ambitious digital trade chapters to help place the UK as a global leader. **As the UK secures new trade deals, the government will include provisions on emerging digital technologies, including AI, and champion international data flows, preventing unjustified barriers to data crossing borders while maintaining the UK's high standards for personal data protection.**

In doing so, the UK aims to deliver digital trade chapters in agreements that: 1) provide legal certainty; 2) support data flows; 3) protect consumers; 4) minimise non-tariff barriers to digital trade; 5) prevent discrimination against trade by electronic means; and 6) promote international cooperation and global AI governance. All of these aims support a pro-innovation agenda.

Al risk, safety, and long-term development

We will as using powers through the National development of his investment Act to monitor risks arising from an small number of potentially emerging factors. A strategic view, the non-aligned Artificial General Intelligence, and the unrepresentee changes that would respond to emerging technologies: the current of the UK and the world, seriously,

**Ministry of Defense** will set the details of the approaches by which Defence A is

There are also risks, Safety and rational development development and their **National Rail** security concerns that the considered **Programming** emphasis emphasis on the theory will be an new non-benefia and targeted support safety, and **certain government** will be an international security apartments to be evaluated as an economics or critical security, and the development of the proposed system.

In this paper, the benefits of the proposed system are evaluated as a national security source and others. So, as it becomes more complex and simply used in some domains, the most materials should be open up to emerging on microsoft and threats, with the tools to understand its most stable.

The Office for A will coordinate cross-experiment processes to accurately assess loss from a safety and risks, which include subtle subtle and sensitive approaches such as evaluating whether of research infrastructure, even the requirements for such a development are not the same or not the appropriate tools to monitor risks, and explore them to maximize progress on \(A\), and \(a\) performance that will not be so.

The performance will support the wide and ethical development of these technologies as

**Policy 3- Gowering AI Effectively**

**Actions:**

1. Develop a non-invocation national position on governing and regulating A, which will be set out in a White Paper, to be published in early 2022.
2. Push Push the OCE assurance advantage and use this to continue work to develop a mature AI assurance ecosystem in the UK.
3. Pilot an AI Standards Hub to coordinate UK engagement in A hybridisation globally, and explore them to establish challenges in the development of an AI standards engagement toolkit to support the \(A\) ecosystem to engage in the global AI standardization landscape.
4. Continue our engagement to help shape International frameworks, and international norms and standards for governing A, to reflect human rights, democratic principles, and the rule of law on the international stage.
5. Support the continuing development of new capabilities around trustworthiness, acceptability, acceptability, and transparency of A technologies via the national AI research and innovation Programme.
6. Publish details of the approaches which the Ministry of Defence will use when adopting and using A.
7. Develop a cross-government standard for algorithmic transparency.
8. Work with The Alan Turing Institute to update the guidance on AI ethics and safety in the public sector.
9. Coordinate cross-government processes to accurately assess loss term A safety and risks, which will include activities such as evaluating technical expertise in government and the value of research infrastructure.
10. Work with national security, defence, and leading researchers to understand how to anticipate and prevent catastrophic risks.

## Next steps

The National AI Strategy proposes three core pillars which, taken together, are areas the UK can make the biggest impact to set the country on its way to being an AI and science superpower fit for the coming decade.

By their nature, strategies are a response to the moment in which they exist - further actions will also be required to elaborate on the paths set out in this document in a way that responds to the fast-changing landscape in the years to come. A plan to execute against the vision set out in this strategy will be published in the near future. Alongside this, we will put mechanisms in place to monitor and assess progress.

We will publish a set of quantitative indicators, given the far-ranging and hard-to-define impacts AI will have on the economy and society. We will publish these indicators separately to this document and at regular intervals to provide transparency on our progress and to hold ourselves to account. Given the cross-cutting nature of AI, collaboration across a wide range of sectors and stakeholders will be paramount. The Office for AI will be responsible for overall delivery of the strategy, monitoring progress and enabling its implementation across government, industry, academia and civil society.

We will also continue talking with the wider community to get their feedback on AI in the UK. Taken together, this quantitative analysis and qualitative intelligence will enable us to track progress and course-correct if we are at risk of falling short in any particular area.
