## Introduction

The standards set out the digital skills needed for work and life across two skills levels:

* designed for adults with no or little prior experience of using digital devices or the internet.
* designed for adults with some experience of using digital devices and the internet but lacking secure basic digital skills.

The standards include a single entry level, rather than three entry sub-levels to reflect how digital skills are typically taught, learned and applied. The entry level skills statements include skills across the three entry sub-levels.

## Foundation skills

Some adults may need support to handle and use digital devices for the first time and to learn the following foundation skills before enrolling on an entry level course:

* Turning on a device (including entering and updating any account information safely, such as a password);
* Using the available controls on a device (such as a mouse and keyboard for a computer, or touchscreen on a smartphone or tablet);
* Making use of accessibility tools (including assistive technology) to make devices easier to use (such as changing display settings to make content easier to read);
* Interacting with the home screen on a device;
* Connecting to the internet (including Wi-Fi) safely and securely, and opening a browser;
* Opening and accessing an application on a device.

These foundation skills are at pre-entry level and therefore, while not part of the standards themselves, will be an important prerequisite for some individuals. They may be included in specifications for essential digital skills qualifications, but must not be subject to assessment.

## Guidance

The **skill statements** which make up the standards represent a distinct, independent skill and aim to be coherent both across the two levels (progression within a skill) and down the columns (skills statements within each level align across the skill areas).

Skills statements have been expressed in terms designed to avoid creating unnecessary barriers to individuals with a learning difficulty or a disability and to support use of assistive technology.

The **amplification** provides more detail on how individual skill statements should be interpreted - clarifying what is and is not in scope for the specified skill at that level. Providing amplification means that the skill statements themselves can remain concise and easily comprehended, and any detail required on the range or depth of coverage intended by the skill statement, and the knowledge and understanding required, can reside in the amplification.

Amplification is only provided where it is required to support interpretation of the skill statements. Where the skill statements themselves are deemed self-explanatory, no amplification is provided.

The knowledge and understanding notes provided for each skill are not intended to be exhaustive, but rather to reinforce the intention that individuals should understand the basic concepts which underpin the skills to be able to develop their own use of technology subsequently.

The **glossary** is provided to support consistent interpretation of common terms across the standards.

## Using the standards

The standards are primarily intended for use by awarding organisations in developing new essential digital skills qualifications, available for first teaching from August 2020.

**Essential digital skills qualifications** must cover all five skills areas set out in these national standards (using devices and handling information, creating and editing, communicating, transactions and being safe and responsible online), and may cover some, or all, of the skills statements in each skill area. The specific skills statements covered by an essential digital skills qualification will depend on its purpose.

The standards will also inform the development of new subject content for **digital Functional Skills qualifications**, available for first teaching from 2021.

It may also include adopting an iterative approach of refining search terms to narrow or broaden searches as required. Searching online may be using a "traditional" search engine (text-based) or using a digital assistant (for example, through voice control).

Searching **on a device** may include searching on:

* file names partial file names file content

_Use appropriate techniques_ includes adopting an appropriate approach to searching based on the type of information sought.
