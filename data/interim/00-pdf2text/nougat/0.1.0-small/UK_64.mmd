## Appendix A bold new phase

By Sir Adrian Smith

Institute Director and Chief

Executive

Stewart Brand once wrote, "This present moment used to be the unimaginable future." It is a poignant reminder of the pace of technological change.

When The Alan Turing Institute was founded in 2015, we had a belief that 'big data' and later, artificial intelligence (Al), would be transformative in the future. Today, just eight years later, this belief has become a tangible reality. Data science and Al are revolutionising the world we live in, changing the way we live, work, and interact.

The opportunities of this transformation are vast: Al-powered medical diagnoses that help doctors save lives, predictive analytics that help governments identify and prevent potential security threats, and machine learning algorithms that enable businesses to operate far more efficiently and provide entirely new products and services.

The full potential of these benefits are far from guaranteed, however, and there are significant risks, too. Real issues around overpromises, misleading claims, bias, transparency and misuse all stand stubbornly in the way. We must take them seriously, tackle them head-on and adopt a mentality that these are problems to be solved now, not once we have released these technologies into the world.

We believe in creating a world where data science and Al are used to make society healthier, safer, more sustainable, and more prosperous. We are deeply committed to driving progress that benefits everyone. This means our work is not just about developing new and exciting technologies but ensuring that they are developed responsibly, with robust ethical standards.

Our ambition in Turing 2.0 is to harness the data science and Al revolution and direct its energy towards solving some of the thorniest challenges we face as a society. We think there is untapped potential for the public good and a national institute is key to unlocking it.

Therefore, we want to be interdisciplinary, dissolving arbitrary siloes and developing holistic solutions, accelerate the transfer of skills and knowledge between sectors so people can thrive, and inform the public and policymakers on the issues that matter most.

Therefore, we want to harness the data science and AI revolution and direct its energy towards solving some of the thorniest challenges we face as a society.

We want to be interdisciplinary, dissolving arbitrary siloes and developing holistic solutions, accelerate the transfer of skills and knowledge between sectors so people can thrive, and inform the public and policymakers on the issues that matter most.

We believe this is achievable. With the right focus and the means to galvanise people across the entire community, including our excellent universities, we can make a real difference to society.

When people think of data science and AI, we want them to think about the positive difference it has made to the lives of millions of people worldwide. The Turing is well-placed and ready to take the lead on this responsibility. Working in lockstep with the wider community, this strategy is how we will do it.

Together, let us create an unimaginably better future.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6329]

The future looks exciting indeed.

Imagine a world where machine learning algorithms can detect early warning signs of disease and help doctors tailor treatments to individual patients. Imagine a world where smart cities can reduce traffic congestion and emissions, while improving safety and accessibility for all. Imagine a world where data science and AI are used to predict the impacts of climate change and guide our mitigations against them.

But this future can only become a reality if we set data science and AI technologies on the right path. That is why the Turing is so important.

With our world-class researchers, national leadership, and strong partnerships, we are uniquely positioned to harness the UK's strengths and lead the way in shaping a future that works for all of society.

I invite you to join us on this exciting journey.

Together, we will drive a model for how safe, ethical and inclusive data science and AI can build long term benefits for society, businesses, the economy and individuals, all while supporting the UK's needs and broader ambition to be a global leader.

Dr. Douglas Gurr

Chair of the Board of Trustees

The Alan Turing Institute

## The data science and AI revolution

In 1950, Alan Turing published a landmark research paper in which he proposed answers to an existential question: "Can machines think?"

That was over 70 years ago. In the time since, both technology and society have undergone seismic changes. Reflecting on the last decade alone, we've witnessed a dramatic rise in computer power, the quality and size of data sets and algorithmic innovations.

Together, these advances have led to the emergence of data science and the resurgence of artificial intelligence -'machines that think'.

There are few things more important to the UK's future prosperity and societal wellbeing than the ethical development and deployment of data science and AI.

## 1 Introduction

Al, specifically, will likely have significant but still uncertain consequences for employment, with some jobs automated but many created. The need for advanced digital skills in many sectors, including science and research, is set to increase12,13.

Crucially, there is enormous potential for Al to complement, rather than replace, jobs, releasing peoples' creativity and expertise for more impactful work. We are seeing glimpses of this already with ChatGPT. The power of human-data science and -Al pairing, not simply replacing tasks, is what holds so much promise for generating new insights and solving hard problems.

## Understanding global trends

The UK has benefitted from being one of the earliest countries to develop a national approach and earmarking resources to enable research and innovation in data sciences and AI.

It is currently ranked third in the world for AI innovation, investment and implementation, following after only much larger countries (US and China)14.

Footnote 14: The Global AI Index - Tortoise (tortoisemedia.com)

The UK has also benefited enormously from its strong track record in research in mathematics, software engineering and computing - some of the fundamental disciplines that underpin data science and AI.

Looking ahead, the UK's position in the international landscape is complex:

### The need for investment

The UK's international ranking can only be maintained through continued investment, research excellence, and strategic collaboration as countries around the world seek to increase their own national capability.

Since Canada released the first national AI strategy in 2017, more than 60 countries have followed suit with their own AI strategy, as well as substantial budget for its delivery.

In Europe specifically, 20 member states of the European Union (EU), and Norway, had published their national AI strategy by 2021.

### Seizing the opportunity

The pressures to accelerate the responsible development of AI and establish international norms will only intensify as the economic and geopolitical advantages to be gained by AI crystalise.

Across the world, industry is recognising this need, and driven by intense global competition, is investing heavily in the future of AI. Private investment in AI in 2021 totalled around US$93.5 bn - more than double the total private investment in 2020. The US continues to lead the world in both total private investment in AI and the number of newly funded AI companies - three and two times higher, respectively, than China, the next country on the ranking15.

Footnote 15: The state of AI in 2022-and a half decade in review | McKinsey

In 2018, "40 percent of respondents at organisations using AI reported more than 5 percent of their digital budgets went to AI," and in 2022 that rose to 52%, while in 2018, organisations used on average 1.9 distinct capabilities (e.g., computer vision, or natural language generation). This has risen to 3.8 in 202216.

Footnote 17: The AI Index Report – Artificial Intelligence Index (2022) (stanford.edu) The 2023 AI Index Report found that the number of bills containing ‘AI’ passed into law grew from just 1 in 2016, to 18 in 2021. Research on fairness and transparency in AI is also shifting into the mainstream and has exploded since 2014, with a fivefold increase in related publications at ethics-related conferences.

### The case for international guidance

With AI's rapid pace of development, there is strong demand internationally for clearer guidance on best practice, and for agreement about standards and ethics.

The UK, with its strong tradition in rule of law and diplomacy, has an important role to play in helping ensure that AI and data science are informed by democratic values and are subject to institutional checks and balances. The Turing will collaborate with like-minded international partners to address this challenge17.

## Introduction

We will facilitate AI adoption among industry and governments by helping develop much needed global standards; and we will work for an approach to AI and digital innovation which protects human rights such as the right to privacy, equality and fairness.

## The value of a national institute

The Turing, as the UK's national institute, has a pivotal role to play in working with the UK community to harness data science and AI technologies for the public good.

By developing these technologies explicitly with this focus in mind, we can help to compound progress for the better.

We are a charity, with a clear purpose to serve society. We are also free of commercial incentives. This means we are uniquely and powerfully positioned to unite, inspire and direct the UK and international data science and AI community, making sure the brightest minds are focussed on the most important societal challenges.

To help us do this, the Turing has built up unique assets and occupies an important niche that complements the wider data science and AI community in the UK.

These assets include:

### Our independent voice

We provide truly independent, impartial and trusted advice for government, industry and civil society.

This includes advocating for the development of open standards to facilitate access to infrastructure and data.

### Our national leadership

Our remit is one of national leadership, providing focus on UK priorities for the public good and supporting the UK's ambition to be a global leader in data science and AI.

This leadership extends not only to science and innovation, but also to public understanding and perceptions of data science and AI, as well the national skills agenda, and leading on issues of equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI).

### Our convening power

The Turing's status as an institute allows us to be interdisciplinary. We broker and convene the data science and AI landscape alongside data sets and domain expertise to tackle the most important challenges.

This builds on the strengths and strategies of partners, including universities, across the UK to address national challenges and deliver benefits that no other single actor could deliver alone18,19.

Footnote 18: Sir David Grant’s independent review of UKRI recognised that ‘Institutes form a critical part of the UK’s research architecture and fill a gap for medium-to-large research programmes and mission-focused research that few universities are able to undertake.’

Footnote 19: The problem of filling the niche for problems which are too large and complex for universities but too long-term for loose networks is recognised elsewhere, for example, in the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change report into ‘A New Model for Science’ A New Model for Science’ A New Model for Science (2022) | Institute for Global Change

The Turing is in a unique position whereby it can convene pockets of excellence dispersed across the UK and effectively harness talents and share solutions for the benefit of the public.

### Our international position

The Turing is a key asset to the UK internationally, acting as a 'front-door' to the UK's data science and AI community. We help ensure the UK's leadership in these areas on a global stage.

## Introduction

We leverage the Turing's brand and reputation to drive international norms and standards, establishing international research relationships and resources, and providing global thought leadership. No other actor in the UK can occupy this space as a world-leading authority with a national remit.

As a national institute, we are uniquely and powerfully positioned to unite, inspire and direct the UK and international data science and AI community.

## From Turing 1.0 to Turing 2.0

The Institute, headquartered inside the British Library's London premises, was created as the national centre for data science in 2015, in response to a recommendation from the UK Council for Science & Technology in 201320.

In 2017, in response to a recommendation made to government in the Hall-Pesenti report entitled 'Growing the Artificial Intelligence Industry in the UK', the Institute officially added AI to its remit21.

Footnote 21: [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/growing-the-artificial-intelligence-industry-in-the-uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/growing-the-artificial-intelligence-industry-in-the-uk) The Institute was set-up as a joint venture (DV) between five universities and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), with each party awarding five-year grants to the Institute.

The government's decision in 2014 to create a national centre for data science has, by 2023, been translated into a high-profile, vibrant national institute for data science and AI, bringing together 38 leading UK universities and eight strategic partners22 with key user sectors, international researchers, government departments, as well as UK and international corporates and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

Footnote 22: LRF, Acenture, Roche, UK defence & security community (MoD, DSTL, GCHQ, MI), ONS, NATS, Gates Foundation and Singapore DSO

The Turing's community now includes well over 500 researchers welcoming over 1,000 students since inception, each linked with a university, and is at the heart of a growing network of institutions bridging academia, industry, government, the third sector and other organisations nationally and internationally.

## Appendix A truly national institute

_To date, the Institute has filled a gap in the UK research and innovation landscape._

We have done this by convening the research community; underpinning new collaborations with industry, third sector and government; developing new training approaches and disciplinary practices; leading the public debate; providing high-quality advice to government; and supporting the national efforts in support of the response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

This new strategy is an evolution in how the Turing, as a national institute, will operate over the next five years.

It is an ambition to be a more _truly_ national institute23, making deep and transformative societal impact, representing and reaching the whole of the UK and being the UK's primary vehicle of data science and AI engagement with the rest of the world.

Footnote 23: Our ambition to be truly national is paired with our acknowledgment for the need to deepen, as opposed, to expand our activities. In this sense, Turing 2.0 will build on what has worked well, as well as what is likely to work well in the future, and ensure those impacts are felt more impressively across the UK and wider world.

## Supporting the National AI Strategy

The Turing seeks to build on the thinking done in various other strategies and plans. In particular, we believe a strong, independent national institute can help deliver on the ambitions and aspirations detailed in the National AI Strategy.

The National AI Strategy describes one of its core aims as: "invest and plan for the long-term needs of the AI ecosystem to continue our leadership as a science and AI superpower"3.

Footnote 24: Transforming our world with AI (2021) (ukr.long)

This is how we will deliver against the National AI Strategy:

### Setting the agenda - and sparking collaboration

Through our thought leadership and agenda setting research, we will provide the direction that drives the AI ecosystem towards shared challenges. We will galvanise the community, foster impactful collaborations and build the critical mass that addresses not just the problems of today, but the long-term challenges of the future.

### Turning ideas into impact - at scale

We will contribute to the aim to "support the transition to an AI-enabled economy, capturing the benefits of innovation in the UK, and ensuring AI benefits all sectors and regions"3 by a focus on turning ideas into impact at scale, and maximising our skills and training offerings to help the whole of the UK take advantage of new technological advancements.

### Driving an informed conversation

We will work to promote an informed conversation around the opportunities that data science and AI presents for the wellbeing and prosperity for everyone in the UK and abroad. We will help businesses and other organisations navigate the complex ecosystem and provide simpler routes for them to make use of these technologies for their own benefit.

### Fostering an environment of excellence

We will help to "ensure the UK gets the national and international governance of AI technologies right to encourage innovation, investment, and protect the public and our fundamental values"3 by utilising our trusted status and well-established excellence in expert advice on ethics, standards and regulation, fostering the environment in which data science and AI technologies can thrive.

The Turing, through the approach set out here, will play a central, UK-wide leadership role in delivering against the important aims in the National AI Strategy.

We also share the vision in UKRI's AI Review24 that AI will be pervasive throughout our lives in 20 years' time and that a strategically well-connected community will help ensure that the UK has the right environment for world-leading researchers and innovators to thrive.

Footnote 24: UKRI Strategy 2022-2027

More generally, the Turing will, through its science and innovation agenda, skills and training offers and ecosystem leadership, support the objectives outlined in UKRI's corporate plan 2022-25. Specifically, our emphasis in science and innovation in Turing 2.0 is geared towards "focusing the UK's world class science and innovation to target global and national challenges."25.

## Working with the wider ecosystem

We know our success in Turing 2.0 will also depend on how well we can effectively alloy the many existing advantages the UK possesses, supporting a well-functioning system of actors throughout the landscape.

### In Turing 2.0, we will:

#### Build a new university network

We will form a new university network

to facilitate better connections across the data science and AI landscape. The network will be open, with minimal barriers to both entry and bureaucracy, and will provide mechanisms to connect across the ecosystem, interesting problems and routes to impact. All UK universities will be invited to join the network provided they meet the relevant eligibility criteria.

We will not be adopting a one-size-fits all approach - how we work with universities and at what scale will depend on where interests align and where working together will be mutually beneficial, for example, using interest groups to grow a community and spark new ideas for research collaboration and projects26.

Footnote 26: Interest groups | The Alan Turing Institute

#### Seek out like-minded partners

In Turing 2.0 we will continue to strive to work with partners who have common goals and aligned expectations with that of the Institute. We already work with and will continue to seek out partners from across industry, the third sector, government, research institutions and international bodies who share our approach - with both strategic partners27 and project partners28 generating public benefit from our work, through open publication, and driving societal and economic impact.

Footnote 27: Typically, multi-year (~5 years), multiple collaborative research challenges – thorny, complex and which require the Turing to convene multi-disciplinary teams to work.

Footnote 28: There around 50 of these project partners running at any one time, and they normally contribute a lower amount of resources compared to Strategic Partners; usually we would focus on one or on a small number of challenges in one or more domains, often at the collaborative research project level. Project partners may in time become a strategic partner of Turing.

We want the results, outputs and outcomes of our work to spread beyond single projects, across domains and sectors, yielding positive transformation29.

Footnote 29: Partnering with the Turing | The Alan Turing Institute We have a separate set of partnership principles that will define our future interactions with partners.

#### Work flexibly with industry

Our partnerships with industry will maintain flexible models of engagement, from larger corporates to small enterprises, ranging from one-week Data Study Groups (DSGs)30 and three- to six-month internships, through to multi-year research programmes and targeted collaborative research projects.

Footnote 30: Data Study Groups | The Alan Turing Institute

#### Respond to government needs

We will also continue to tailor our collaborations around the needs of our government partners. Our partnerships range from small-scale research projects to multi-year research programmes, and we will build on this flexibility in Turing 2.0.

We actively encourage all policy makers with difficult-to-solve policy problems, unwieldy data sets, or an interest in data science and AI to work with us.

### The four steps to partnership

Whilst partnership development is rarely linear and straightforward, in a process sense, the following four-steps diagram is a helpful illustration of how it is possible to move from an early conversation with a partner all the way through to a long-term partnership:

\begin{tabular}{p{113.8pt} p{113.8pt}}  & \\We recognise that there are a host of communities and groups that fall outside the network of universities and research establishments, industry adopters and government departments, which we have built links with through Turing 1.0.

Through Turing 2.0 we seek to expand our bespoke approach towards new groups such as SMEs, local community networks and AI research hubs. Different groups will require and expect a different level of engagement from the Turing ranging from frequent involvement in roundtable discussions, contributing to communities of practice through to leading and managing forums.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6344]

Our purpose

Turing 2.0 reaffirms The Alan Turing Institute as the UK's national institute for data science and artificial intelligence.

The Turing's purpose32, consistent with its status as the UK's national institute, remains consistent with the original rationale for its inception:

Footnote 32: Previously, we have referred to this as our ‘Mission’.

**'To make great leaps in the development and use of data science and artificial intelligence in order to change the world for the better.'**

## 11 Our principles

How will we achieve our goals, day to day?

Our principles will guide everything we do. They define how we work as individuals and as teams at the Turing. They also shape how the Turing operates as a responsible leader, as we impact and influence beyond our organisation.

These principles will help the Turing fulfil its mission and bring to life the potential of data science and AI to create public good.

Our ten principles are:

### Lead responsibly

The Turing operates for the public good. We are constantly looking for ways to make significant, long-term improvements to peoples' lives through data science and AI.

We take our responsibility for national leadership seriously and embody it in everything we do.

### Build confidence, ensure independence

The Turing works to establish the conditions in which everyone can make an informed judgement on the role of data science and AI technologies in their lives. We recognise the importance of the UK's historical achievements in these areas as an important bedrock on which we can build, boosting the confidence that people and organisations have in interacting with these technologies.

We maintain trust in the Turing as an organisation by communicating honestly and openly; empowered by our independent status. We always aim to be the balanced voice in the room.

### Enable impact - at scale

The Turing focuses on where impact matters most for the public. We think big, focusing our efforts on national priorities where scale is vital for making major progress. Our national status and convening power are important tools we use to build critical mass and activate the stored energy of the wider community.

Our research, training and engagement activities are always looking to flexibly scale to match this ambition and we use pilots to gather the evidence we need to commit.

### Drive interdisciplinarity

We view data science and AI as a glue that can combine expertise across relevant disciplines and sectors, unlocking insights.

We also believe the key to developing transformative progress in data science and AI lies in going beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries to make new connections and uncover novel relationships between ideas and problems.

### Move with agility

Data science and AI technologies are constantly evolving. The Turing must adapt and prepare accordingly. This means empowering those who are closest to the technological frontier by providing them with the necessary agency and clear responsibility to deliver. We remain focused on our vision but not to the extent that we blinker ourselves to changes that may take us in positive new directions.

We prioritise and encourage a low bureaucracy environment. We understand that structures, processes and methods are in service of our aims, not ends in themselves, and can and should adapt.

### Continually innovate

Innovation is the process of taking ideas from inception to impact. This means a commitment to end-to-end thinking and assessing activity as part of the Turing's overall innovation system.

Core to innovation is the creation of value. The value we create through innovation is that of tangible progress against societal challenges. We achieve this not only by inventing something new, but also by reapplying ideas in novel and improved ways.

### Embed equality, diversity, and inclusion

To make the great leaps in research that we aspire to, we promote and embed equality, diversity and inclusion in all of our functions and activities.

Our EDI Strategy[33] details our commitment to how we are tackling this challenge through our roles as an employer, a research institute and a national leader.

### Collaborate and convene

We do not operate alone but through a federated network, building on the strengths and strategies of partners across the UK and internationally. Wherever we can, we proactively identify and leverage partnerships with those who have the data, knowledge, and pathways to impact, and we build research capability to make progress against societies' biggest challenges.

We do this because we value a diverse range of people, data and ideas and believe that bringing together the best talent in the data science and AI community is what will produce wide-reaching benefits for the public.

### Learn - and help others learn

We are deeply enthused and energised by what we do, and we want to improve. We use our unique position in the landscape to grow and support those who share our passion for data science and AI.

We use feedback loops deliberately to inform us when we're right or wrong and we are open about what we learn. We exploit the quick knowledge gained from pilot schemes to know when to scale and when to try something different.

### Democraise access

Everyone has a stake in data science and AI. The Turing works to broaden involvement in understanding and creating these consequential technologies through the development of - and improved access to - information, infrastructure, data and methods.

These principles will permeate everything the Turing does. They will require continuous reinforcement through their embedding in our systems, processes and mechanisms.

"We are committed to inviting the UK public into the data science and AI conversation, through engaging dialogues and events that put people's questions, concerns and aspirations at the heart. All of our principles will help support this endeavour."

Sophie Melvor, Director of Communications and Engagement

## 6 Imaging our future

What are we aiming for?

Ten years from now, the Turing will be internationally recognised as a centre of research and innovation that harnesses the power of data science and AI to make a lasting impact on the world's most pressing societal issues.

When people think of data science and AI, they will think about the positive difference it has made to the lives of millions of people around the world.

Our experts, working closely with our partners, will develop innovative solutions to the world's most difficult problems, from the climate and biodiversity crisis to the transformation of healthcare. In doing so, the UK will earn a reputation for being the most successful country in the world at directing advancements in data science and AI towards problems of real, societal importance.

The Turing will have a major presence in the UK, with strong partnerships with universities, large and small companies, government departments and agencies, and charities, and will host major conferences and other events.

The Turing's skills programmes will be the gold standard for training the data scientists and AI engineers of the future in meeting the needs of different sectors. They will equip students, leaders and practitioners, including those from other domains, with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the data-driven world.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6350]

From vision to reality

How will we achieve our envisioned future?

The data science and AI revolution is happening at speed and this compounds uncertainty. Our strategic approach - the route to our vision - is designed with this in mind.

## An unprecedented pace of change - a key challenge

Like many new technologies, research in data science and AI is rapidly evolving and in doing so, producing new avenues of understanding, opportunities, and risks.

As these avenues are explored, the actors operating within the overall landscape proliferate, as does the development of new tools and their applications.

Pockets of world-leading excellence exist across the UK and abroad, but these rarely have the scale necessary, by themselves, to move the needle on significant, national and international problems. Such pockets also often lack the total end-to-end system which can take novel ideas all the way through to impact.

We see this evidenced in research where the hardest problems require inputs from multiple disciplines, data sources and experts. It is manifested in the skills agenda, through the wide range and varied depth of technical, ethical and business expertise required for different problems and sectors. And, it is apparent in the engagement with the public, business, government and third sector where reliable advice, guidance and standards all compete against confusion, misinformation and limited attention.

It is obvious the Turing cannot solve every problem in data science and AI. Instead, what we can do is focus our attention on a significant challenge, one that we are well-placed to help solve, and that if solved, will lead to significant advances towards realising our ambitions.

A key challenge in the next five years is that data science and AI will - we believe - continue to evolve in unpredictable ways, and the speed of these developments will make it increasingly difficult to connect the people, ideas and data required to make progress against important societal issues.

In response to this, the Turing will provide an end-to-end, interdisciplinary pathway in data science and AI that enables impact at scale and drives major progress against societal challenges.

## Our guiding approach

We have devised an approach to overcome the obstacles this key challenge - an unprecedented pace of change - embodies.

Our approach is to provide an end-to-end, interdisciplinary pathway in data science and Al34 that enables impact at scale and drives major progress against societal challenges.

By providing avenues for collaborative and impactful interdisciplinary research at scale, unique skills offerings that link academia to industry and government, and engagement that incorporates and helps to unify informed voices which others can be confident in, the Turing can make real progress against this key challenge.

Footnote 34: This entails providing the means to make major progress against societal challenges. The ‘means’ of an end-to-end system are basic theoretical advancements, applied research, creating open, useable tools, encouraging and enabling adoption and end-user use, developing necessary cross-sectoral skills, and ensuring a well-informed environment for better public understanding, including regulations and ethical standards.

"We will provide an end-to-end, interdisciplinary pathway in data science and AI that enables impact at scale."

## The approach

- in action

This is how we will enact our approach to drive progress against the Turing's three goals, helping to realise our ambitions.

- a handbook to reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science37.

Footnote 37: The Turing Way The Alan Turing Institute

As data science and AI rapidly develop, the problem felt most acutely in science and innovation will be in the difficulty in doing genuinely interdisciplinary research and reliably translating this to impact.

### Good:

Advance world-class research and apply it to national and global challenges

### Interdisciplinarity and unlocking impact at scale

As the national institute for data science and AI, science and innovation not only sits at the heart of 'the why' we do things, but also 'the what'.

In Turing 1.0, we settled on 'programmes' - a mixture of shapes and sizes - that convene and deliver research activity either in specific domain areas or cross-cutting areas (and were loosely aligned to a set of broad challenges).

These have delivered many successes, from the creation and adoption of a new discipline - data-centric engineering, to helping to diagnose dementia38, forecast Arctic Sea ice coverage36, and producing The Turing Way - a handbook to reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science37.

Footnote 38: Fast feedback loops between discovery and development phases are a key characteristic of successful organisations in science and innovation (S&I) and will be integrated into our S&I structures (e.g. Bell Labs, Laboratory for Molecular Biology, Cambridge, Janelia Research Campus)

As data science and AI rapidly develop, the problem felt most acutely in science and innovation will be in the difficulty in doing genuinely interdisciplinary research and reliably translating this to impact.

### Approach:

Grand challenge-led

In the next phase, we must take a much more deliberate approach, more closely coupling our'science' to 'innovation', lending a more distinct focus on the end-to-end system from foundational research, through applied research to end-user impact39.

Footnote 38: Fast feedback loops between discovery and development phases are a key characteristic of successful organisations in science and innovation (S&I) and will be integrated into our S&I structures (e.g. Bell Labs, Laboratory for Molecular Biology, Cambridge, Janelia Research Campus)To this end, we are defining a series of grand challenges in key societal areas to focus our activities, underpinned by a core capability of tools, people and foundational infrastructure, translating this into commercial and societal benefit. At the same time, we will always keep our eyes open to emerging areas of strategic importance.

A national institute can provide enormous value in fostering interdisciplinary, which in this instance also requires a cultural change in how data science and AI research is done. Data science and AI is well-placed to act as the glue for this change, with the Turing's national and international reach pulling in wide-ranging expertise from across sectors and disciplines.

Indeed, as the capabilities of AI increase, the question of how to partner human expertise with it will become more profound and pressing, making interdisciplinary not just desirable, but utterly indispensable.

Understanding a grand challenge-led approach has several benefits that will drive progress against societal challenges in that it:

* Provides a common focus, clear direction and a mandate to prioritise which is often lacking in the complex research and innovation landscape
* Inspires and motivates diverse communities and capabilities to come together to achieve a common goal by incentivising investment and buy-in
* Dissolves siloes between disciplines, organisations, sectors and countries by the multifaceted (and often global) nature of challenges which demand interdisciplinarity
* Creates spill-over benefits by the nature of the journey

These grand challenges will have corresponding missions which will constitute more targeted problems which require portfolios of activity to be achieved39.

Footnote 39: Grand challenges, such as the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals’, ensure focus, but are considered too broad to be actionable. Conversely, objectives are actionable but typically remain isolated in their impacts if not clearly linked to others which compound to reach societal impact. Missions sit between grand challenges and objectives, setting clear targets that can only be achieved by a portfolio of objectives. Missions should balance being broad enough to engage the public and attract investment; and focused enough to involve industry and achieve measurable success. As such, a mission can make a significant and concrete contribution to meeting a grand challenge.

### Defining our grand challenges

How do we identify where our efforts are best placed?

Given the scale of resources that other nations can bring to bear, we take it as a basic organising principle that we will need to focus our efforts around areas where:

* There is a significant societal or economic challenge or opportunity to address
* The application of data science and AI could have a transformative impact on the domain
* in turn built on either unique assets, historical strengths or distinctive capabilities
Applying the three tests outlined above led us to select the following areas of focus for grand challenges for the Turing's R&D efforts:

#### Health

To transform healthcare to enable better outcomes for all.

#### Environment and Sustainability

To address the climate and biodiversity crisis and the need for greater sustainability.

#### Defence and National Security

To protect the UK, its people and the places they inhabit.

We are working closely with the community to develop missions, but illustrative examples of our thinking could include:

* In Health: Risk prediction and early diagnosis
* In Defence and National Security: Autonomously defending critical national cyber-infrastructure
* In Environment and Sustainability: Quantifying biodiversity change and ecosystem health

Our work with the Turing is enabling us to develop approaches that will ultimately generate insights into disease, patient, and outcome heterogeneity using advanced analytics." Ryan Copping, Global Head of Data Science Acceleration, Product Development at Roche

## Grand challenge: Health

### To transform healthcare to enable better outcomes for all

The recent global pandemic has brought starkly into view the scale of the transformation needed for health and social care systems around the world to be able to continue to ensure the future health of the population.

The challenges include the obvious demographic pressures in many nations of an ageing population, increasing levels of multiple-morbidity, the rising real-terms cost of healthcare, the need for a more integrated approach across both health and social care, and the opportunities arising from the revolution in data science and AI.

This last challenge is perhaps the greatest of all as medicine globally evolves from a largely reactive process of dealing with the consequences of diseases to a world in which data enables a more proactive focus on the prevention and the earlier identification of disease, and earlier better targeted interventions.

In computer science terms, the challenge of mapping a large set of static and dynamic input data (in a medical context: one-time genomic mapping or retinal scans coupled to the dynamic streaming of basic biomedical data from wearable monitoring devices or more granular information from devices such as pacemakers) to a defined set of outcomes (a heart attack, the development of breast or prostate cancer, the onset of diabetes) is a fairly classic'machine learning' problem. Recent developments in this field are proving extraordinarily powerful in making progress in previously intractable areas such as computer vision, natural language parsing and recognition.

There have been several early efforts in this space, including the Turing's joint research initiative with the British Heart Foundation (BHF). Yet, despite the huge challenge to healthcare budgets globally, we have yet to see widespread or systematic applications of data science or AI techniques to the - arguably far more compelling - challenge of using this newly available data to predict the onset and development of disease or the response to treatment.

Constraints on progress have included the difficulty in pulling together coherent longitudinal data sets, legitimate and ongoing concerns over the implications for patient privacy, and the interaction with existing healthcare funding models.

We believe the time is ripe for a concerted multi-year research effort to translate the idea into a practical working methodology and ultimately into clinical practice.

### Applying our three tests

This grand challenge area clearly passes test one (a significant economic or societal challenge) and test two (the opportunity for data science and AI to have a transformative impact).

We believe (test three) that it is also a domain where the UK is uniquely well-placed globally to drive this effort since we have available the four key elements we believe will be necessary for success: a world class medical research community, a concentration of world class data scientists AI practitioners, access to large patient data sets (with patient permission to use these) primarily through the Trusted Research Environments created by organisations such as Health Data Research UK (HDR UK), institutions (including medical research charities such as Wellcome, Cancer Research UK and the BHF) and major life sciences firms (Roche), that are capable of making a significant multi-year funding commitment to support the necessary research.

Our impact so far Case study: Ensuring quality in AI healthcare technologies

Clinical trials are routinely used in health research to test the safety and efficacy of new treatments and products. A growing number of these medical interventions have an AI component, such as AI-assisted diagnostic tests, smart wearable devices, and personalised apps40.

Until now, however, there had been no universally agreed set of standards for assessing the quality of trials involving AI, making it difficult for the interventions to be compared with each other.

In September 2020, the first international guidelines for the design and reporting of clinical trials involving AI were published in Nature Medicine, The BMJ and The Lancet Digital Health.

The work was funded by the Turing, along with the Wellcome Trust, Research England and HDR UK. The two sets of guidelines, called SPIRIT-AI and CONSORT-AI41, provide checklists for researchers to follow to improve the quality and transparency of their trials involving AI.

The guidelines will help researchers, peer reviewers, funders, journal editors and regulators to ensure that AI technologies in healthcare are supported by the best possible evidence.

Footnote 42: Understanding urban air quality | The Alan Turing Institute

#### Case study: Understanding urban air quality

Poor air quality in cities poses a threat to health and life expectancy. More than 9,000 Londoners a year die early due to air pollution. However, a revolution in air-quality sensors means pollution can now be tracked at thousands of locations in the city, but such sensor networks produce an overwhelming amount of data of varying quality42.

Researchers from the Turing, the University of Warwick and partners including the Greater London Authority, developed algorithms, data science platforms and statistical methodology to make sense of this data deluge.

The group is forming a real-time monitoring network that enables high-resolution air quality forecasting. With a better understanding of air pollution in a complex urban environment like London, it will be possible to design better policy interventions, accurately evaluate interventions, and reduce the health impacts of pollution.

### Grand challenge: Environment and Sustainability

#### To address the climate and biodiversity crisis and the need for greater sustainability

We know that life on earth started around 3.5 billion years ago and that life has spread to every corner of the land and sea. The fossil record also teaches us that over that vast period there have been five occasions when almost all life on earth disappeared. We call these mass extinction events.

The problem is that the evidence is telling us we could be heading towards a sixth mass extinction; and this time, it is an extinction we are causing. We understand the causes: they include climate change, land use and pollution. We also know that it is not too late to turn this around.

Dasgupta43 and others have clearly demonstrated that there is a path by which we can grow the global economy but without over-consuming the earth's natural resources. It's a narrow path and not the one we are currently on - but there is a path.

### Applying our three tests

This is the second area of focus for the Turing's R&D efforts. It clearly passes test one - an existential threat to much of life on earth and an area in which vast new industries will be created as the world transitions to a 'green' economy.

We also have conviction - based on early work in areas such as environmental forecasting, the tracking of global resources, the automation of species monitoring and the quantification of biodiversity loss that this passes test two: data science and Al can have a transformative impact on the transition to a green economy.

On test three we also believe that the UK, through multiple areas of expertise and unique data sets held in world leading organisations such as the Met Office, the NERC British Antarctic Survey, the Natural History Museum and Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, has the unique assets, historical strengths and distinctive capabilities to help us better understand our world. Furthermore, we will work with leading organisations - including existing strategic partners, Lloyd's Register Foundation (LRF) and NATS - on how the engineering, energy and transport sectors will help enable the UK emerge as a global leader in the development of the tools and technologies leading the transition to a green economy not only benefiting the UK but helping to create a world in which both people and planet can thrive.

### Our impact so far Case study: A new age of Arctic science discovery

A new era of polar exploration has begun, but this time through collaboration between climate scientists and data scientists44.

Researchers at the Turing and British Antarctic Survey took Al algorithms formerly developed for use in the commercial sector and were among the first to apply them to climate science, aiming to uncover hidden relationships within sea ice data that are likely to be missed by traditional data analysis or simulation methods.

With over 10 million data points in their satellite-derived dataset, the team is training its Al algorithms to forecast future sea ice at a resolution of 25 kilometres, with the ability to learn physical relationships between climate variables over both space and time.

These powerful new methods are being developed specifically for this project, but the researchers are already mapping out other avenues of climate research that could benefit from them, including understanding the drivers of urban heatwaves and predicting future regional water security.

"Engaging with Turing Fellows has opened up our environmental datasets to new ways of exploration that we never thought possible. The time has clearly come for the Al and environmental research communities to come together and tackle some of our greatest global challenges, including the climate emergency and the loss of biodiversity."

Scott Hosking, Head of the Al Lab at the British Antarctic Survey, and now Turing Senior Research FellowGrand challenge: Defence and National Security To protect the UK, its people and the places they inhabit

Defence is already well-established focus at the Turing, including recent international project (US Department of Defence) and strategic partners (Singapore DSO), that have been attracted to our Defence and Security work.

We have been addressing these challenges since 2017 with the UK defence and security community (Ministry of Defence, GCHQ, Dstl and MI5) - to ensure a safe, secure and prosperous society, including the application of AI ethics to defence and security projects.

#### 1.3.1 Our impact so far Case study:

_Informing UK security policy through evidence-based, interdisciplinary research on emerging technology issues_

The Centre for Emerging Technology and Security (CETaS) is a policy research centre based at The Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national institute for data science and artificial intelligence.

The Centre's mission is to inform UK security policy through evidence-based, interdisciplinary research on emerging technology issues.

The Centre has already produced insightful reports on human-machine teaming46, the predictability problem and implications for national security47, Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs)48 and the future of open-source intelligence49 to better inform the national security community.

#### Case study:

_Al for Cyber Defence (AICD) research centre_

Advances in intelligent autonomous agents, such as those based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), have demonstrated super-human capabilities across a range of simulated and game-based tasks. Recent ground-breaking performances include enhancing the speed of fundamental mathematical operations, and defeating the world champion of the popular multiplayer real-time strategy game Dota 2.

These breakthroughs have been made possible by new developments in DRL, allowing intelligent agents (IAs) to identify winning strategies despite imperfect information, highly complex action and observation spaces, and immense game trees. Until now, the computer security and privacy research communities have been largely focussed on conventional (un)supervised machine learning.

While this type of AI is great at classification, for example identifying malicious computer binaries or anomalous network traffic, it does not natively support learning from interaction. DRL and related techniques offer a mechanism for planning strategically that we intend to show, through AICD, can transform our understanding of, and capacity to attack and defend, computer systems and networks.

AICD will aim to answer questions like: "To what extent can a computer network be actively managed and defended by intelligent autonomous agents?, "Can your attacker model resist an autonomous adversary?,"Can IAs find vulnerabilities in mainstream applications?" and "Does an RL agent make a credible cryptanalyst (or cryptanalysts assistant)?".

### The power of partnerships

Partnership is vital to the success of Turing 2.0.

In each of these grand challenge areas the Turing has been investing in building new and existing partnerships to bring together domain expertise and access to unique datasets to combine with the Turing's expertise in data science and AI.

Examples in each domain include:

* In Health: Five years of experience in joint funding of the BHF-Turing data science into cardiovascular research programme, an upcoming exclusive partnership around the application of AI to healthcare data with HDR UK, as well as the strategic partnership with Roche.
* In Environment and Sustainability: The joint workshop between the Turing, the Natural History Museums and others to help define the new and emerging grand challenges where data science and AI can help address the climate and biodiversity crisis, in support of the work we do with NATS and LRF.
* In Defence and National Security: The Turing's recently publicly announced partnership with MI5 which, amongst other elements, supports the UK's Defence and Security organisations in keeping abreast of state-of-the-art approaches to data science and AI that can be used to respond more flexibly and more quickly to threats to UK national security.

In each of these areas, the Turing will be working with its domain partners over the coming months to further define a series of 'grand challenges' and associated'missions'.

These will ensure our joint resources are focused on the most urgent, compelling and potentially transformative problems in each domain.

It is vital we continue to collaborate and convene, bringing together diverse expertise nationally and globally to co-create impact that's greater than the sum of our parts. At the same time, the Turing will be a leader and innovator, guiding the way." Professor Mark Girolami, Chief Scientist

### Digital Society and Policy

UK science has historically struggled to translate academic research brilliance into commercial and societal success. There is enormous potential for data science and AI to drive a new generation of public services which are efficient, smart, and responsive to both complexity and uncertainty. Similarly, advances could improve resilience and economic security through real-time monitoring of the economy, its financial systems, and supply chains, as evidenced through the work the Turing is doing with Office of National Statistics (ONS), Accenture, HSBC and others.

Driving productivity has been a systemic challenge for the UK for many years, as well as the provision of more inclusive, fairer and robust services. This 'digital society' could help to address this, for example, our work with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation can increase inclusion and security through digitalisation, removing friction and unnecessary intermediaries50. We provide leadership in the landscape to develop an actionable framework for the trustworthy deployment of AI, and establish digital sandbox environments to enable validation and testing of emerging technologies in a transparent manner.

Turing plays an important role in the development of data-driven policy innovation with expertise in building cutting edge data science and AI models for decision making, public service delivery and regulation processes. This is a role that only a national institute can play, bringing additionally to the country's research landscape and empowering Government to lead the way in innovation. We can provide access to leading multidisciplinary expertise and ensure confidence that the tools developed are state-of-the-art, coherent, and compatible across policy domains.

We will use our end-to-end interdisciplinary approach to fully explore opportunities to improve the digital- and data-driven economy. This includes developing models to better understand economic networks through transaction data and economic nowcasting, developing privacy-enhancing technologies to improve data flow across government departments, building data-driven models for economic policymaking or working with regulators, and building monitoring systems for detecting market collusion and systemic risks.

Turing's research and development in this field offers large economies of scale due to the horizontal nature of AI - a model or tool developed in one vertical sector has multiple applications right across policy domains. Indeed, given our experience and engagement in the application of data science and AI across a diverse range of fields, we are uniquely positioned to help build sophisticated and interconnected models that incorporate a variety of data, from the economy to public health, to provide robust, considered insights.

The Turing is well positioned to convene the best of the academic community, and support the government by working with ONS, and other similar organisations, to improve decision-making via actionable intelligence, enabling rapid policy interventions. We will continue to expand this work and foster government innovation to further our impact across the grand challenge areas and related domains.

### Our core capabilities

Our multi-faceted, cross-cutting core capabilities will power our progress.

They will provide the infrastructure we need to meet our grand challenges. They will provide the underpinning infrastructure - whether that is the access to hardware; foundational technologies such as digital twins and AI foundation models; the development of tools, practices and systems; or a cohort of professions who help translate this into impact.

These capability areas are essential to Turing 2.0:

#### Data science and AI capability

One debated topic has been the role of the Turing in progressing the fundamental science around data science and AI and whether this is a task that should sit within the Turing or elsewhere.

Our view here is that the Turing should absolutely participate in foundational science - and we will build a foundational capability in data science and AI in support of the above grand challenges - but that foundational science more broadly can happen simultaneously in many places and the individual Research Councils are better places to determine how best to allocate resources in this area.

#### Open-source infrastructure

As these foundational data science and AI technologies are becoming ever more prevalent in the UK with common needs and challenges arising, solving for these needs and challenges requires novel tools, practices and systems which can unlock advances across the wider sector and accelerate innovation.

Our Tools, Practices and Systems programme currently represents a cross-cutting set of initiatives which seek to build open-source infrastructure that is accessible and inclusive to all, which we will continue to build in order to empower a global, decentralised network of people who connect data with domain experts.

#### Research software engineering

The improvement of data sets and deployment of cutting-edge algorithms and approaches, remains a barrier in the delivery and translation of research.

Our Research Engineering Group (REG), which has become a model for similar groups across the UK, will expand in proportion to the scale of our broader R&D activity, to continue to contribute skills in research software engineering and data science in support of national priorities.

Much of the time and effort in many of the research and innovation projects is absorbed by finding and improving datasets from which further research can be applied. The availability of data is a significant barrier to advancements in the field and the cleaning and organisation of that data drains the resources of research teams and can halt progression in some cases. Having dedicated teams such as REG and data wrangling greatly alleviates these issues and accelerates the progress our researchers can make.

#### Expertise translation

A core capability to support translation of our communities' science and innovation activity will be an expanded team of Research Application Managers and Community Managers.

#### 4.2.3 Our impact so far

_Case study: Open minds - changing the culture of data science_

The crisis of reproducibility in science is well known51. The combination of 'publish or perish' incentives, secrecy around data and the drive for novelty at all costs can result in fragile advances and lots of wasted time and money. Even in data science, when a paper is published there is generally no way for an outsider to verify its results, because the data from which the findings were derived are not available for scrutiny. Such science cannot be built upon very easily: siloed science is slow science52.

Footnote 51: Challenges in irreproducible research (2018) (nature.com)

The Turing Way38 is an evolving online 'handbook' on how to conduct world-leading, reproducible research in academic data science and Al with the goal of making reproducible research "too easy not to do". The handbook deals not only with the 'how' of things, but also the 'why' - the ethos and long-term benefits of reproducible research.

Footnote 52: Changing the culture of data science (2019) [ The Alan Turing Institute]

The Turing Way has been shared with a growing, global community of like-minded expert advocates, shining a light on a broken publishing system that works against sharing and makes research less effective. It represents the Turing's commitment to changing data science for the better.

_"The reuse of other people's data provides useful insights for new research questions and products, and drives new scientific discoveries."_

#### Case study:

_Al Standards Hub_

The Al Standards Hub53, set up in 2022, in partnership with the British Standards Institution (BSI) and the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) and supported by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and the Office for Al, is an important part of the UK's National AI Strategy - the Hub's mission is to advance trustworthy and responsible Al with a focus on the role that standards can play as governance tools and innovation mechanisms.

A rapidly growing range of Al-related work is underway across an increasing number of Standards Development Organisations (SDOs) around the world. Against this background, the Hub aims to help stakeholders navigate and actively participate in international Al standardisation efforts and to inform the direction of these efforts.

Dedicated to knowledge sharing, community and capacity building, and strategic research, the Hub seeks to bring together industry, government, regulators, consumers and civil society, and academia with a view to:

* Shaping debates about Al standardisation and promoting the development of standards that are sound, coherent, and effective
* Informing and strengthening Al governance practices domestically and internationally
* Increasing multi-stakeholder involvement in Al standards development, and
* Facilitating the assessment and use of relevant published standards

_"As the UK's National Standards Body BSI is delighted to be playing a central role in the Al Standards Hub, a world leading initiative to increase understanding of the standards that are supporting the deployment of Al technologies, and to inform the development of new standards. One of the most important of these for businesses of all sizes will be the Al management standard ISO/IEC 42001, which we will championing as a British Standard in the UK, and which will help companies take advantage of Al technologies in a responsible way."_

Scott Steedman, Director-General, Standards, BSI

### Clustering and amplifying existing UK capability

We recognise that to make real progress in our grand challenge areas, we will have to maximise the full breadth of the UK's existing expertise, as well as build new capability.

Turing Research and Innovation Clusters (TRICs) will be a key delivery mechanism to do so. TRICs will provide a binding capability that supports our grand challenges and the underlying missions.

The purpose of TRICs is two-fold: as well as bringing together expertise from across the UK to amplify research outputs, they accelerate efforts to achieve our own missions that share a technical basis. This will accelerate progress towards grand challenges by clustering similar missions together around a common focus, facilitating information sharing and avoiding duplication of efforts.

In addition, they are an answer to the problem of how we deliver necessary advancements in data science and AI in support of our grand challenges, where the Turing and its existing partners do not have the capability.

TRICs will also work hand-in-hand with the Turing's foundational capability, utilising research to build key technologies. Foundational research will be inspired by grand challenges and therefore create outputs that can be directly taken up by TRICs to achieve missions.

TRICs will bring together this foundational research from the Turing and elsewhere and force-multiply it to generate useful products. TRICs will, therefore, be a way of maximising UK strengths and be complementary to the Turing's core capabilities.

### Horizon scanning

We are humble enough to understand that the future is hard to predict and that it is unlikely we have made perfect choices in selecting these areas of focus.

To this end we will continue looking ahead, keeping a close watch on emergent technology areas such as quantum computing or application areas where the UK has (or could build) a leading position, such as financial services innovation or manufacturing engineering.

We will also be on the lookout for where we can add value to the skills pipeline and improve the public conversation around these technologies. That said, our current focus is on executing well on the areas above.

**Goal:**

Build skills for the future

### The data science and AI skills gap

To remain a science and AI superpower the UK has to invest in skills and talent.

The AI skills gap is well documented54,55. For example, according to the UK Digital Strategy, the digital skills gap is estimated to cost the

UK economy f63 bn per year in lost potential GDP and is expected to widen, resulting in a workforce inadequately equipped to meet the demands of the digital age. Employers say that only 48% of people leaving full-time education have the advanced digital skills required, and many companies cite lack of available talent as the single biggest constraining factor to their growth.

However, despite significant investment, the demand for those who are appropriately skilled continues to grow. The solution to this problem is complex. There is of course a need to ensure actors across the landscape are continuously upskilled and appropriately literate in data science and AI technology and principles, including its responsible use and the breadth of opportunities provided by this technology, but the solution extends well beyond this.

The training offer itself must be comprehensive, innovative and high quality and cover all sub-disciplines and levels of study of data science and AI. School and further education (FE) curriculum need to be up to date, fit for purpose and geared to enthuse students to take up careers in this field.

Roles and responsibilities of data science and AI progressions in organisations need to be well defined and understood, and appropriately adapted and applied.

And finally, career pathways need to be inclusive, appealing and varied and support a diverse population of practitioners with the freedom to move across a wide range of application domains.

_"Employers say that only 48% of people leaving full-time education have the advanced digital skills required to meet the demands of the digital age."_

**Approach:**

Accelerating the transfer of skills and knowledge between academia, industry, government and the third sector

The Turing alone cannot solve all the problems in the skills pipeline. What we can do is fill some of the gaps.

As we remain committed to accelerating the transfer of skills across academia, industry, government and the third sector, we will capitalise on our unique position within the ecosystem. Often, we will do so in partnership. At other times, we will provide guidance and signposting.

We will continue to provide leadership through our position as co-chair of the Data Skills Taskforce, a body of over 25 organisations that convene to address the skills challenges in data science and AI.

Our primary approach to skills will be to provide pathways to support the transfer of skills and knowledge between academia, industry, government at all career levels.

The Turing is uniquely placed to provide additive career opportunities that support both the individual and their wider team to gain cross-sectorial experience.

Over the next five years we will extend our existing flagship programmes (Data Study Groups, Connections, Enrichment, Internships), to work on AI and data science problems identified under our Grand Challenge areas, and covering all career levels from undergraduate, masters, PhD, Postdoctoral researchers and PIs.

In addition, we will launch our newly developed Turing Research Fellowship programme (for postdoctoral-level researchers) and develop an offer for apprenticeships to support entry into the field of data science and AI. Some of these programmes will be open to international audiences.

Placement programmes are just one way of addressing this challenge. Knowledge exchange through the development of case studies with organisations such as the Royal Statistical Society (RSS), our strategic partners or other Turing initiatives (e.g. Turing Commons and the Turing Way) will be shared publicly.

The range of career pathways available to data scientists and AI students and professionals are often not understood or visible.

Continuing our work with AfDSP, a group of UK professional bodies and a government laboratory established to set industry-wide professional standards for data science, we will raise awareness of its work with domain specific organisations.

### _Data science and AI training_

An important component in our approach will be to support domain experts to better understand and implement data science and AI in their own domain areas. Since the skills shortages in these areas show no signs of abating, and many companies turn to upskilling56, the Turing will put in place, or signpost to those of others, offers that enable these experts to take advantage of our placement programmes and training opportunities, supporting our approach and thus the creation of a healthier talent pipeline.

Footnote 56: The state of AI in 2022–and a half decade in review | McKinsey

We will scale existing initiatives such as our Data Science and AI Educators Programme, which build skills and capacity through our 'train-the-trainer' approach for potential instructors and domain experts, our Research Software Engineering and Research Data Science courses, together with the REG team, as well as courses on AI Ethics and Governance (Turing Commons). The Turing has just launched a new Online Learning Platform in 2023, which includes courses on Responsible AI.

One area of focus relevant across sectors is the understanding of the computational requirements for data science and AI - cloud, high-performance computing (HPC) and quantum - to increase the impact of the investments made into advanced computational infrastructure. The aim would be to clarify the national landscape, align and signpost existing learning interventions and highlight and fill gaps in the learning provision as required. This is not an area the Turing should or would tackle alone and we would work with others who are already renowned in this space.

#### Capacity building initiatives for business

To date our skills work with business leaders has been limited; however, in building capacity and skills in the talent pipeline, we need to ensure our offer addresses the challenges and needs businesses face, and indeed those leading are appropriately equipped to ensure the adoption of data science and AI in their organisation.

Our first steps will include working with others in this space (e.g. Catapults and Innovate UK, Data Skills Task Force) drawing on work already done, to create business leader personas, including pain points and challenge and support networks, in order to design suitable learning interventions.

#### Our impact so far

_Cast study:_

_Data Study Groups (DSGs)_

DSGs bring together external organisations from industry, government and the charity sector as data "Challenge Owners" with talented multi-disciplinary researchers who work together to generate innovative data science solutions.

Challenge Owners are frequently impressed at the creativity and speed of progress on what have often been intractable data problems within their organisations. Participants learn new data science skills and ways of working that help them prepare for future employment. Some have returned to take up leadership positions within the DSG team and further develop their real-world experience of knowledge exchange best practice.

Additionally, the Turing has been able to build the outputs of DSG challenges into fully-realised research partnerships, including "Project Bluebird" with NATS67 and the strategic partnership with Roche58.

Footnote 58: The Alan Turing Institute – Roche strategic partnership | The Alan Turing Institute

In Turing 2.0, DSGs are set to keep growing, with the Turing developing a model for sharing our expertise and experience to enable more university and regional partners to run DSG events, as well as integrating DSGs with other two-way talent flow programmes.

## Goal: Drive an informed public conversation

### High-profile misunderstandings

Public perceptions of data science and AI range from futuristic science-fiction to very real distrust and concern about the fairness and transparency of algorithms being applied in public life.

Recent high-profile incidents of algorithms or statistical models being applied in public life with little transparency, and algorithms trained on flawed data reinforcing inequalities have further damaged trust and understanding of how these technologies can be used effectively for public good.

There is a real risk that the positive potential of safe and ethical data science and AI, as envisioned by the Turing, may not be realised without significant coordinated work improving understanding in this space.

### Approach: An informed national voice on key issues

The Turing can provide balance, speaking to both the technical, and social and ethical dimensions of these technologies, presenting both the positive opportunities, as well as the risks.

We can build public confidence, offering an informed independent voice on what can be a complex and controversial area. Recognising we are working in a fast-moving space, we will concentrate our attention on high-profile scientific or policy issues which are set to have an impact on those areas and where our contribution can be most effective.

We will help bring balance and empower informed decision making by:

### Developing frameworks, informing regulation

Providing effective advice and building confidence requires the development of frameworks, codes of practice, and tools to ensure that ethical principles and a consideration of public voices are built into every stage of the design, development, and implementation processes for AI systems.

It also requires well-crafted laws and sensible regulation that clarify the socially acceptable uses of these powerful technologies. The good news is that paying attention to issues of bias, accountability, and transparency may result in frameworks for innovation that are more responsible and safer than ever before. The Turing can drive a new generation of governance and regulation for data science and AI that ensures fairness, safety, and the protection of public interests across the digital economy and society.

### Reaching underrepresented audiences

We will work in partnership with civil society and advocacy groups to best reach underserved and underrepresented audiences, using innovative methods to stretch beyond traditional science communication approaches.

We will monitor our diversity data and outcomes to consistently evaluate our efforts and course correct if we're not reaching target audiences or achieving our aims.

### Engaging sub-groups with a unique perspective

We recognise the importance of establishing links and participating in forums with subgroups that have a unique perspective or interaction with data science and AI, such as the SME community. We seek to provide a bespoke and appropriate offer to the range of audiences and stakeholders which have a vested interest or are directly impacted by the advancement of this technology.

In each case, we seek to engage with these groups in a two-way conversation, reaching underserved and unique audiences not only allows for a balanced message to be shared, but also to be informed. In hearing the needs, concerns and expectations of the wider ecosystem, we can reflect this in the research we undertake and the activities that we pursue.

### Increasing access to information

We also want to ensure high quality and reliable information about data science and AI reaches across all parts of society.

### Our impact so far

#### Case study: AI UK

For the past three years, The Alan Turing Institute has hosted AI UK - an annual two-day event showcasing the best of UK's research and innovation in AI and data science.

In 2023, AI UK will offer up to 3,000 attendees from academia, industry and government (both in-person and virtual) access to over 100 discussions, demonstrations, lightning talks and workshops showcasing the latest discoveries and talking points from world-leading experts, on subjects ranging from online safety to climate and human rights. Through AI UK, the Turing curates world-class research, inspires innovation and importantly convenes stakeholders, including policymakers, across the UK's diverse AI ecosystem around key societal challenges.

AI UK also serves the Institute's goal to be truly national and inclusive. AI UK 2023 will feature a lively exhibition space with over 50 scientific demonstrations selected via open call, and over 10 fringe events held by partners around the UK. In 2022, 37% of attendees to AI UK were from underrepresented groups in AI.

**Resides the motivation, excitement and hope from all the inspirational speakers, AI UK has also re-confirmed my decision to pivot my career and I'm very much looking forward to a role in data science for the public good!**

**AIUK event attendee**The Turing on the global stage

We have established a strong international reputation, engaging with partners around the world.

In Turing 2.0, we will look to cement and build upon this further.

The challenges that will occupy the Turing's attention over the next five years are rarely restricted to the UK's borders. In science and innovation, an area where international collaboration is commonplace, the areas of focus for our grand challenges and their missions are global in their nature.

The climate and biodiversity crisis are universal concerns for all nations, as we all depend on the planet's shared resources. Healthcare is an unavoidable priority for everyone, and the problems therein will not be limited to the UK.

In defence and security, the shared safety and prosperity of countries with a commitment to an international order that preserves values like democracy, human rights and self-determination, is dependent on cooperation

_"The challenges that will occupy the Turing's attention over the next five years are rarely restricted to the UK's borders."_

between those very countries working together on common threats.

And lastly, the transition to a digitally and data-driven economy is powered by economic, social and political forces that derive their energy from across the world and their effects are likewise felt across the world.

The Turing's international role is not limited to science and innovation, either. In skills, it is clear that the demand and supply for data science and AI expertise is an increasingly intense global competition. For the UK to succeed, developing these skills within our borders must be paired with attracting talent from beyond them.

And when considering the challenges in informing policymaking and formulating norms, standards, regulations and frameworks for these technologies, we are confronted with the reality of the shortfalls of doing so in isolation.

Given the pressures to move quickly, whether economic, security-related or political, establishing agreed-upon, responsible means to advance data science and AI is synonymous with generating wide-reaching buy-in across countries. The UK's international reputation for rule of law and diplomacy make it a natural global leader in developing AI regulation, standards and ethics.

The Turing's focus will be on exploring opportunities to collaborate with international partners and capture key lessons as a mechanism to complement the UK's own domestic resources across science and innovation, skills and public and policy engagement.

The Turing's role in leading and influencing conversations on the international stage will be a priority, especially considering the challenges in informing policy making and formulating norms in light of the rapid technological developments we are currently seeing.

Of course, in Turing 2.0, a key focus will be to build relationships with other national institutes and research organisations. There remains much potential in this space, and we will be exploring these opportunities as we endeavour to complement and augment the UK's capacity in data science and Al through international collaboration.

As always, we will be guided by a commitment to open-sourced research, research excellence and the co-design of collaborative projects with partners over contract or consultancy research.

In this context, the Turing's international presence will also operate at many scales. The Turing will continue to work with individual researchers, whether part of our science and innovation efforts, broader skills offerings or through our engagement.

Likewise, in Turing 2.0 we will further develop our relationships with large companies with an international footprint, as well as with relevant foreign governments and key intergovernmental organisations, providing expert advice on behalf of the UK.

## 6 Setting our evolution in motion

The transition from Turing 1.0 to Turing 2.0 will be an evolution.

This evolution will naturally be graduated, with our structures, processes and activity system shifting over time to align with all that we have set out above.

There are several important steps on this path that are worth highlighting as an indicator of how we will begin to enact the strategy:

### Interrogate the detail, across sectors

We will dive more deeply into the specific interactions between our current and proposed activities and those across the landscape.

Whilst we are confident in our approach and overall complexion of how we want to deliver it, we will be working closely with partners across sectors to explore and decide upon the details that will ensure we can most effectively collaborate and maximise impact.

### Define our grand challenges

We will articulate and communicate more details and specificity around our grand challenges and their associated missions.

Work is underway on this task already and will continue at pace over the coming months. We can't deliver on these alone, so the input and commitment of the community is vital.

### Work with universities in new ways

We will be transitioning how we interact with our excellent university network.

The Turing's university partners have contributed hugely to Turing 1.0 and in Turing 2.0 we want to see this success expanded and enriched across the UK, in keeping with our desire to be a _truly_ national institute.
