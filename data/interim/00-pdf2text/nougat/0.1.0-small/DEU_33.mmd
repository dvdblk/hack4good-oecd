Quo vadis, Germany?

The first direct insights is that most German Transformers are positioned near the end of the extraction border. While is enough to reach the first in the first decade, this is not the case when everyone is able to correctly analyze progress and thus continuously pin-the brain the reward. Therefore, there are no data on option.

The \(A\) market continues to advance rapidly, and 54% of leaders across industries consistently showed how important the technology is their better. However, German companies are at the bottom with only 5% considering AS solutions as important in the next years.

The same reluctancy can be seen when comparing AI investments. On average, 50% of the respondents should reorder around an increase in investments, compared with 70% of the German respondents. On the other hand, with 60%, twice as many respondents in Germany reported a planned decrease in \(A\) investments compared with 3% globally.

Considering this apparent evidence to insets and see the relevance, there are also striking differences with German organizations with it increases more potential on AI, compared with international competitors who use AI technology as a key to success over the next years and do most accordingly.

in Germany report that their AI investment will increase in the next fiscal year, compared with 76% globally.

## Introduction

## Introduction

Findings show that challenges weigh harder in Germany

Surey responders reported varying challenges depending on the usage of _Air_ implementation, when starting new _Air_ projects, the first reported challenge is growing. As this baseline both globally (GP) and Germany (GA), as participants attempt to design or the AP process, the AP process presents potential challenges among the new _Air_ projects. The AP process, German reports potential challenges among the new _Air_ projects. Most notably, (3) are managing-related tasks as a challenge compared with 50% globally. The _Air_ projects that depart respondents consider less complex compared with other global configurations. For example, when 30% and 40% the researchers, respectively, this first increase the corresponding process in German organizations, when an organization is starting with an implementation API approaches, the highest cluster is growing to the business and other dosing the _Air_ technologies. Once an organization has passed the initial 30%, the ongoing, the business has an upper challenge. The challenges between the ongoing economic community, the classification of most beneficial _use_ cases, and the maintenance of its applications.

The challenges in the design/making importance of other hardership and produced investment are discussed in \(A\) research. A major part of building an \(A\) designed organization requires a discipline and focus to maintain systems and algorithms so that they can compute to generate enough-use instead of noise. Such discipline and tools to a system discovery and understanding of all associated challenges that may not be obvious in the early stages of an _Air_.

Seeing results

Interestingly, 87th of the global respondents and fifth of the German researchers reported that they calculate the length of the global respondents in total with the expected time or even more quickly than expected. While on the other hand this indicates an increased understanding of implementation requirements, it could also suggest that the score for all my two to broadcast on most savings, and that the transformation opportunities that can offer with them have less predictable timelines, are being described or ignored.

In the future experienced when trying to the importance of reduced costs as an outcome, German responses reported reduced costs on to be the best achieved outcome, ranging from 25th to 12th. At 10th-th-th-year, increasing significantly more than the global scale, in contrast, German responders were less likely to report outcomes more sooned to transform important opportunities, such as enabling new business service months, as achieved in a night context, decreasing 20th. In 2020, in 2020. When organisms profiting effective time transformation outcomes, such as Germany's 150, revenue generation or business innovation, can fall by the available.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:15]

German companies have to work hard to close increasing deficits in workforce optimism

The failure to realize the importance of meeting from the future can have a major impact on how AI is seen by the workforce. Global, 82% of the researchers believe that working with AI technologies will not only enhance their performance but also degrade significantly.

Our primary aim of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of the change management aspect, what's going to be required. They think it's always going to be easier."

## 6. Actively addressing AI-related risks is essential

The resources regarding risk management support this hypothesis. While it is capable of regulatory and transparency in all decisions, poor progress, and this offers synergy views these risks directions that are not privacy concern management, and safety decisions about AI investments in an \(A\) regulatory culture are neglected. The ultimate goal system, among others, all follow up as efficiently data that affect all the surveyed organizations, Germany is studying on. It takes 80% of the former employees, Germany is studying on. It takes 80% of the other nation's policy, which is the biggest percentage across all countries, with a global average of 50%. Thus, trading a-related data exchange may impact on organizations of efforts.

However, despite their apparent access from economic perspectives on the influence of transparency in related risks, the survey shows that German organizations are such among the necessary steps to manage those risks, which are listed in risk management is signed with the organizations broader risk management effort, only 24% of the German responders spread. Compared with 33% globally.

Furthermore, German organizations seem not to consider ethical risks in a dataset lookout the concerns of the workforce in particular, trends of AI conform to more in management.

A preliminary study of German organizations are concerned about the influence of jobs due to AI, compared with 38% globally. Additionally, the global findings show that 41% are concerned about the manufacturing power of AI, compared with 52% across the German responders. Interestingly, 41% (Whitney) brings on ensuring that progress provides well as checks and balances are made to the best organizations on other public networks when they adopt an ethical risk framework that aligns with Trustworthy AI principles.

## 2 Action 2 Transform operationsof you're not changing how you work, you're leaving value on the table

As it has become demonstrated in success, a large number of organisms are recognizing for business operations around \(A-\)key steps using the operator additions such as catalyst and ethics. Despite this, most organisms still have for to stop achieve maturity in this area, and therefore the best one has to start to register a requirement reported since the last action of the same.

Despite evidence establishing their process and rendering these other daily daily will remain in trended outcomes, there has been little growth in the market in terms of adopting such practices according to some way researchers in either the late two State of AI.

As we have the whole of the challenges we adopt, the percentage of researchers, both globally and in terms of reporting to change or analysis fashion to document MOSPs for all of the two.

This would seem to be especially concerning, considering this number of users to try around 13 richness considering only respondents reporting to change using MOSPs.

In this study, the survey finds that the whole organizations' transformations and particularly those both globally and in terms were significantly more likely to adopt operational leading practices than the one organization. Interestingly, however, high-volume assignments in scenarios are largely independent from other forms. Most notably rely on the high-volume organizations' fields (those MOSPs are in Germany) combined with high-volume (the discrepancy continues with organizations' following processes for considering and comparing the data used by AI models, with 68% and 77%, respectively.

This indicates that even high-volume organizations in Germany are little behind the global counterparts. They are still strong, accurate technical effort which is known to seriously riskless progress after a brief study advantage presented.

**Action 3**

Orchestrate tech and talent
## Technology and talent acquisition come together in the era of AI

One of the major changes that AI presents to any organization in the need for talent technology and talent resources in tandem, looking at each as a source of critical set-s - a human system machine collaboration.

When looking at different energy laws from solutions are advanced by organizations, or survey ghosts in interesting but not surprising - for most surprising - for high-volume organizations, the energy more specifies AI applications to have a higher percentage of AI applications but in those, compared with organizations with fewer \(A\) applications. The systems that organizations that have been developed in the coming decade later, open under the following but but laterized \(A\) solutions in order to further extend their competitive advantage with AI.

However, the ability of an organization to achieve differentiated and exploitable with AI still requires in turn out in the near context, it is not being the driving-based approaches globally and in Germany where their engineering experienced professionals is the primary to obtain a list for organization. This however is a challenge due to the shortage of skilled AI, which has been well documented in particular.

Despite further the advantages of other AI skills come from, our survey downstream and global responses to the aligned, except the following ones with only 20% of researchers, Germany can only rely on existing thermal employees trained in AI than the global average of 29%. On the other hand, Germany's high-energy networking networking networks with 33%, compared with 25% globally. This further underscores Germany's ability to provide highly useful talent - the best generation of professional workers.

SummarySummary

German organizations should take AI-ready culture & leadership along with operational leading practices to heart

This year. Germany contributes a disproportionously high number of organizations associated with the strongest AI to actions (Transformers and strains) or to the 3 countries surveyed. Despite the steps in our approach, the system is a good foundation allowing to enrich the system from the system running against this new generation of primary high-volume organizations should address. Surprisingly, the system remains the international responsibility in this process.

The second author is the first author to present from the advancement of AI. With designed to achieve suitable activities in the field of view1 to be presented by team organizations. This report reveals the major shortcomings that German organizations should take to heart,

Finally, the key shows that German organizations are tagging for further global counterparts in culture and leadership around AI. However, according to our system, they change outher and leadership around AI is key to the sustained success of AI at least 6 organizations. Moreover, respondents reported significantly less usage of operational leading practices, especially MIQs. In German organizations, Store these practices are newly considered to be Acknowledgements
