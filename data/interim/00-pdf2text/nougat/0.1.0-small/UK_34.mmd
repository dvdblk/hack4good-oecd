We are at a critical juncture for UK manufacturing. An array of recent developments, from political and macroeconomic events to the increasing pace of extraordinary technology developments, point to volatile and disruptive times ahead. It's time for a rethink. Industry 4.0 is poised to drive transformation across global manufacturing. Innovative technologies such as intelligent robotics, 3D-printing and artificial intelligence, combined with new approaches to data management, will help manufacturers and the supply chain save time, boost productivity, reduce waste and costs, and respond more effectively to consumer demand.

UK manufacturing has an opportunity to position itself as a globally attractive and competitive base for advanced manufacturing, producing the best-designed products that are competitively priced. For this to become a reality requires industry to work closely with government to advance the UK's industrial digitalisation, bring the right skills into the industry, and take advantage of the opportunity offered by the UK's exit from the European Union. The government's recent industrial strategy green paper is a positive and welcome step in the right direction, yet it remains to be seen how this will play out in practical terms on the ground. If these challenges are not effectively addressed, manufacturing and associated industries are at risk of decline. Collaboration between sectors, as well as between industry, government and the education sector, will be critical.

It's an ideal time, then, for KPMG to have commissioned this research among the UK's leading manufacturing executives to understand how they anticipate the impact of Brext on their organisations, and their highest priorities for a long-term and coherent industrial strategy from the UK Government.

Recommendations based on these findings will contribute to the dialogue between government, manufacturers and the education system. A focus on openness to foreign investment, access to talent, engagement with new markets, a positive regulatory and legal environment, and a coherent industrial strategy will drive the UK to new levels of competitiveness and ensure manufacturers are ready to capitalise on Industry 4.0. The future is made here.

## Chapter 4 Overview

UK manufacturing is facing new horizons. Disruption is growing exponentially, driven by a multitude of factors, from technological innovation and evolving customer behaviour, to regulatory changes and a turbulent global landscape, all requiring businesses to innovate with ever-increasing speed. With the advent of the fourth industrial revolution, known as 'Industry 4.0,' the UK has an opportunity to position itself as a global centre of excellence for advanced manufacturing.

At the same time, the UK's decision to leave the European Union could have great impact on the sector's future -- particularly as it affects state aid rules, trade, regulation and the labour market, central to strategies for growth in this industry.

The UK Government has promised a more joined-up industrial strategy to help meet these challenges; to address the competitiveness of the UK economy, by focusing on measures that will increase productivity and drive innovation-led growth. How much of this will translate into longer-term, concrete action, however, remains to be seen.

This _Rethink Manufacturing_ report from KPMG in the UK uses in-depth interviews and extensive survey data from leaders in UK manufacturing to explore what they want to see from a UK industrial strategy, and to assess the potential impact of Brexit on this sector's future planning.

### 4.1 Our findings:

#### 4.1.1 Gearing up for Industry 4.0

The majority of respondents to our survey agree that Industry 4.0 represents an unprecedented opportunity to revitalise UK manufacturing. Nevertheless, respondents seem less sure about how it will affect their business and whether they have a coherent strategy and the right talent and skills to capitalise on it.

This is concerning, but not necessarily surprising. While Industry 4.0 may be much talked about, many manufacturers struggle to understand what it means for their business and how they should prepare for it in practical terms.

KPMG's recent report, _The digitalisation of the UK automotive industry_, highlighted the enormous economic benefit to the UK from industrial digitalisation. The results from this survey suggest that the UK Government will need to do far more to support UK manufacturers across the supply chain, to support the adoption of new technologies, help businesses improve levels of R&D and improve collaboration between business, education and academia.

#### 4.1.2 Increasing productivity: workforce skills

When it comes to raising productivity and improving the competitiveness of the UK's manufacturing sector,the number one priority for manufacturers is boosting workforce skills. As the pace of technological change increases, manufacturers are suffering from an increasing gap between supply and demand for STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) talent, which the government recognises in its recent industrial strategy green paper.

The aerospace and automotive sectors have both led the way with sector-led strategies to target these skill gaps. The Aerospace Growth Partnership has created 500 new masters' degrees in aerospace over several years. Likewise, the automotive industry has adopted a similar approach to attract more of the right skills into the industry. The Apprenticeship Levy also comes into play this year, which should help create another attractive path for entry into the manufacturing industry.

Manufacturers will need to consider the different skills they will need in a more automated future, and collaborate closely with government to ensure the national education system will deliver the skills required and that university funding is maintained post-Brexit. Manufacturers will also need to develop strategies for continuous upskilling or "lifelong learning" of their workforce, in order to keep pace with innovation.

## Responding to Brexit

The UK's vote to leave the EU has been a game changer for UK manufacturing. When our survey was carried out in December 2016 and early January 2017, two thirds of manufacturing executtives surveyed said that the uncertainty from Brexit would be bad for UK economic stability.

Nevertheless, don't let a good crisis go to waste. Even uncertainty from an event like Brexit can be the catalyst for companies to transform in a positive way.

Our research finds that companies are considering a number of measures to plan for this potentially radical change. For example, a third are considering relocating aspects of their plant or operations to another country in order to boost productivity or reduce costs, with China and India the most attractive destinations for relocation.

There is also a slight but notable increase in consideration of moving elements of the supply chain away from the UK. While this might seem counter-intuitive at a time when the low bound value is encouraging greater investment into the UK, businesses with interconnected pan-European supply chains may be planning for the possibility that the UK exits the EU Customs Union without an EU-UK Free Trade Agreement in place. For such businesses, tariffs and non-tariff barriers, e.g. delays in border clearance, could prove costly.

Likewise, the survey shows increased EU-based business development and marketing investment in order to remain close to customer demand in the EU. Strategies for dealing with cost increases show that over a third of manufacturers are planning to pass these onto the customer, while the majority plan to offset them, either by achieving cost savings elsewhere or accepting reduced profits.

### A long-term industrial strategy

Our survey shows huge support for an increased government focus on industrial policy, with nearly four out of five respondents saying this would benefit them.

The sector-specific approach has found notable success in the aerospace and automotive sectors. For example, the Aerospace Growth Partnership, founded in 2010-11, has helped develop the right skills, supply chain capability and technology to help the UK aerospace sector maintain market share.

But does the government have a good track record of picking winners when it comes to specific sectors? Respondents to our survey are wary of an industrial strategy that supports only sectors critical to the national economy, and would prefer the government to focus its efforts on cross-sector (horizontal) policies, such as financial support for R&D and boosting workforce skills.

Likewise, regional development features second to last on the list of priorities where manufacturers would like government to focus, with the majority of respondents considering the government's current approach to regional development disjointed and unclear.

A balance will need to be struck between the government's focus on reinvigorating regions experiencing low productivity, and the preference for companies to base themselves around clusters where expertise and supply chains already exist.

A way to marry these competing priorities may be to increase coordinated focus on emerging ecosystems. For example, investment in the the next-generation'mobility ecosystem', spanning car manufacturers, fleet managers, telecommunications, infrastructure, finance, insurance and cyber security. By focusing on four or five fields of play where the UK could build particular expertise, the government could play a valuable coordination role, supporting a series of big sector or cross-sector concerns, and providing strategic incentives.

### What does UK manufacturing need from an industrial strategy?

This reports highlights that there are some areas where UK industry is unsure about future developments, but there are also signs that the manufacturing sector is positive in the face of change and ready to harness the opportunity of remaking itself into a global centre of excellence for advanced manufacturing, with a clear roadmap to future success.

Above all, there are key areas where the UK Government should focus its industrial strategy to support UK manufacturing; boosting skills; maintaining a competitive infrastructure and business regime relative to other OECD countries; incentivising investment in innovation and collaboration between industry, education and science; and most importantly, supporting the UK's industrial digitalisation.

Government support is vital, but industry itself must also step up by improving its own productivity through recruiting and developing new skills and preparing for Industry 4.0. Only through government, industry and the education sector coming together to rethink manufacturing will the UK manufacturing industry be able to seize new opportunities and sources of long term growth.

The conclusion of the report goes on to outline some immediate steps manufacturers should make in anticipation for Brexit in 2019, and longer-term strategic priorities that manufacturers and the UK Government should work on together.

## Summary of priorities

### Gearing up the UK for Industry 4.0

- Increase financial support for R&D into emerging technologies

- Invest in emerging ecosystems, such as those around future mobility and healthcare

- Priortise a competitive digital infrastructure

- Implement developing global digital standards

- Formulate a long-term plan for smart infrastructure

### Boosting productivity: the missing skills

- Develop a long-term talent strategy

- Integrate lifelong learning into business culture

- Collaborate between manufacturers, adjacent sectors, government and academia to fill skills shortages

- Develop new technical accreditation and standards

- Undertake a comprehensive review of the National

- Curriculum

### Preparing for Brexit

- Model scenario outcomes to plan ahead and mitigate risk

- Plan to move inventory/stock closer to markets

- Finance or re-finance to lock in lower cost of capital

### A business regime that supports the manufacturing industry in the short and long term

- Reform business rates and consider bringing back the

Industrial Buildings Allowance

- Readjust tax credits and subsidies to incentivise

manufactures

- Reduce tariffs on top products currently purchased

customs duty free from EU Member States which

may become dutiable after Brexit (e.g. cars, truck and

associated parts)

- Accelerate international mutual recognition standards

- Focus on a stable corporate tax regime

## Appendix APerhaps this is why responses to our survey show more enthusiasm than preparedness for Industry 4.0. The majority (56%) think that Industry 4.0 represents an unprecedented opportunity to revitalise UK manufacturing. But respondents seem far less sure about how it will affect their business and whether they have a coherent Industry 4.0 strategy and the right talent and skills to capitalise on it.

Surprisingly, mid-size companies are more likely to believe they have a coherent strategy for Industry 4.0 (49%) than large companies (37%). Mid-size are also more likely to believe it will have a major impact on their business (54%) vs large companies (35%)*.

"The reality is that many manufacturing businesses are currently struggling with day-to-day business," says Charlie Simpson, Partner with the Global Strategy Group at KPMG in the UK. "So while many companies will be talking about Industry 4.0 in principle, their intent to invest and build a business case for it is probably going to be patchy at best."

There are structural issues in UK manufacturing that don't help. Simpson argues, for instance, that the UK, unlike Germany, lacks the volume of major players and smaller investors that can help drive the coordination and standardisation of technology required for Industry 4.0.

All of this could generate substantial economic benefits for the UK. A recent survey KPMG conducted on behalf of the SMMT identified the cumulative benefit of automotive digitalisation at E74 billion by 2035.1

Footnote 1: The digitalisation of the UK automotive industry, “KPMG in the UK, 2016

Above all, manufacturers see innovation as the key differentiator for the UK as a manufacturing centre of excellence.

Establishing the UK's position as a leader of manufacturing innovation in the age of Industry 4.0 will require greater investment than ever before into levels of R&D, commercialisation of R&D and the adoption of new technologies. Nearly half of respondents expect R&D activities in the UK to increase in the next three years. The UK currently trails other OECD countries on its investment into R&D, investing 1.7% of GDP into R&D, below the 2.4% OECD average and far behind the world's leading manufacturing economies: China (2.1%), USA (2.79%), Japan (3.49%) and Germany (2.88%).

For the UK to position itself as a future advanced manufacturing base, government will need to do more to boost R&D levels in the UK, and particularly its commercialisation, as highlighted in the government's industrial strategy green paper. The 2016 Autumn Statement included a welcome increase in government investment of E4.7 billion by 2020-21. The key question will be how this additional R&D funding will be delivered to incentivise greater innovation in the UK.

The aerospace sector, in particular, has focused on sustainable improvements to the UK supply chain in order to attract greater international investment. Its Supply Chain Competitiveness Charter, for example, commits 11 of the biggest aerospace companies to expanding opportunities in the UK for UK suppliers. Kakkad explains that this means that for all the investment the government puts in, there is a reciprocal commitment from industry to prove they can live up to it. He cites as an example Boeing, which is working with its UK suppliers to improve their understanding of the company and its tendering process.

Other aerospace supply chain initiatives include 'Supply Chains for the 21st Century', which helps companies with quick but sustainable productivity improvements, and 'Sharing in Growth', a far more intensive programme aimed at ensuring that the sector's suppliers are "truly world class". Kakkad hopes that such programmes might now translate into bringing together industries facing similar challenges -- the automotive, rail and nuclear industries, for example -- under a cross-sectoral framework aimed at improving UK supply chain productivity.

## Appendix A Appendix

In the short-term, the game changer for UK manufacturing will prove to be Brexit. Theresa May said in her Lancaster House speech on 17 January that the UK would leave the Single Market and seek a new relationship with the Customs Union.

That suggests the UK is heading towards a "hard Brexit," and in our survey two thirds of manufacturing execs said that the uncertainty from Brexit would be bad for UK economic stability. However, change - and even uncertainty - appears to bring with it positives. Nick Harrison, Partner at KPMG in the UK, points out that an event like Brexit can spur companies to transform. "Brexit will force a paradigm shift," he says. "It could be putting a new CEO in place, leading to a new strategy, or it might be taking a fresh pair of eyes to the whole process, breaking it down, mapping it out and implementing practical process improvement."

Our research shows confidence, despite the uncertainty. Nearly half of respondents, for example, think R&D activities will increase in the next three years, as well as increased investment in Industry 4.0 technologies, including artificial intelligence, advanced robotics, the Internet of Things and augmented reality. This also ties in with the post-Brexit business confidence we've seen from UK manufacturers in the monthly Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI figures.3 Meanwhile, larger companies (E10 billion or more in annual revenue) are generally more pessimistic, with 60% most likely to view a "hard" Brexit as negative compared with 36% of small companies (with less than E5 billion in annual revenue), which may reflect the fact that smaller companies are less likely to export.

Footnote 3: UK manufacturing kids off 2017 on the right foot, KPMG in the UK, February 2017
A significant number also think there will be no impact from Brexit. This correlates with further findings where respondents seem relatively optimistic about the UK's attractiveness for FDI investment following a hard Brexit. The majority think there will either be no change in the UK's attractiveness or it will improve (23% and 37%, respectively).

This positivity is perhaps surprising, given that respondents anticipate challenges in the next three years. Unsurprisingly, the biggest negative change to exports and imports is expected to be to and from the EU. Seventy five percent of respondents currently have manufacturing operations in other EU countries, as well as the UK.

Although the biggest decrease in imports is from the EU, it should also be held in context that a third expect imports from the EU to increase over the next three years.

Government should therefore be investing quickly to ensure there is a focus on maintaining a frictionless border similar to the one currently in place, otherwise trade will be more expensive and less efficient as a result of non-tariff barriers. Moreover, any efficiencies achieved in the area of UK/EU trade could be leveraged by future FTA partnerships. We predict that trader accreditation systems like Authorised Economic Operator (AEO), which enable mutual product recognition, will become a default requirement.

## Manufacturers' focus after 2019:

Overall, our research finds that manufacturers are considering a number of measures over the coming years in preparation for the UK's exit from the EU.

### Partial relocation

Although most have no immediate plans to leave the UK, a third are considering relocating some aspects of their plant or operations to another country in order to boost productivity or reduce costs.

### Manufacturers considering relocation out of the UK shown by company size:

Many companies may be considering relocation as a means of maintaining a foothold in the EU post-Brexit. The choice of location will be driven by a number of factors, including the specific industry sector requirements and the skills required. Countries such as Germany and the Netherlands are frequently favoured. Ireland has always been a strong choice and its popularity is growing - especially with those companies who are familiar with the UK as an investment location.

Magnetic and industrial products and from the UK.

Over the next three years, the number of countries with 64-10% of their supply chain based in the UK will shrink from 2 to 16%.

This may seem slight, but Justin Benson thanks this could be one of the most challenging issues facing companies that have increased supply chains across Europe. "The sixteen supply chains have acquired the key tiny have not decades, distorted around countries of expertise, technologies and investment structures, with free movement of labour resources than "The key". The risk we feel is that different of supply chains start to mitigate away from the UK to create the change of expertise that are accessible at other scale in the EU's.

While a shift away from the UK may seem counter intuitive at time when the build-up device value is increasing its investment, businesses with target EU operations are already putting in place plans to mitigate deaths due to fast federal deficit and household leaders imposed in the post-Great era.

At the same time, 40% of companies saw they will be splitting more foods into asteroids butiness and transfers are not so bl bl. In the next three years - a figure that rose to 40% among respondents from smaller companies. Next Harrison, Patrick at KWK in the UK finds this may be down to companies reviewing their investment portfolios and feeding that is the way of the UK leaving the Single Marcus they will need to remain close to anomalies. "Comments will be reviewing whether their footprint matches where the demand will cause from in maybe the next five to 10 years of their business." Its says.

## Impact of Brexit on manufacturers' finances:

### Strategies to deal with higher costs

If they are faced with rising costs, 35% of companies expect to pass these onto the customer. The majority (66%), however, plan to offset rises by either achieving cost savings elsewhere, or absorbing them and accepting that profitability will be reduced.

The majority think the key impacts of Brexit will include a rise in operating costs (63% say this) and those associated, pressure on operating margins (62%) and a negative impact on the bottom line due to indirect taxation (63%) - including customs duties.

It appears that smaller companies are more likely to be concerned by the impact of indirect taxation than larger organisations, and are also more likely to be preparing for this expected impact.

Meanwhile, 39% of mid-sized manufacturers are looking for new sources of financing and investment following Brexit, compared to just 9% who say this from large companies. According to Justin Benson, Director, KPMG in the UK, manufacturers should already be working on their relationships with banks. "Manufacturers should be financing or re-financing their business to lock in lower cost of payment periods."

the UK as the best place in which to invest in R&D -- prior to Brexit, at least. Perhaps as a result of this targeted strategy, the UK currently has the second-largest aerospace sector in the world.

Cross-sector (horizontal) strategiesHowever, when it comes to government policy, is there a successful track record for picking winners when it comes to specific sectors? Respondents to our survey are wary, and strongly prefer the government to focus its efforts on cross-sector (horizontal) policies, such as financial support for R&D and boosting workforce skills.

Kakkad agrees that more could be done on cross-sectoral policies -- in anaesthesia such as skills development, cooperation tax, capital allowance, R&D tax credits, and a research and science base that is aligned to industrial innovation. "This is an opportunity to make sure that wider policies are actually pulling in the same direction and that there is a "whole government" approach to industrial strategy," he says.

Both Nick Harrison and StephenCooper highlight the importance of investing in common infrastructure -- both physical, to improve product flows across territories and free up supply chains, and digital, specifically and most basically the improvement of high-speed broadband connectivity and investment in 5G technology,

### Regional development

A regional or place-based approach to development is more complex. In January, the 'Northern Powerhouse' took centre stage once more, with the government reiterating its promise for E556 million in extra funding. A 'Midlands Engine' strategy is promised soon.

Nevertheless, almost three quarters of manufacturing executives responding to this survey (72 %) are critical of the government's current approach to regional development, deeming it disjointed and unclear.

A balance will need to be struck between the government's focus on reinvigorating regions that have little industry and low productivity, and the preference for companies to base themselves around clusters where expertise and supply chains already exist.

"For a global sector such as aerospace, I don't think any kind of region-first, or place-based approach would work, because then you get places competing and not necessarily being strategic at a national level," says KakRad. "From my perspective, a national sector strategy sits on top of the place agenda, giving focus to it." This may also explain why regional development features second to last on the list of priorities that respondents would like the government to focus on.

### Developing the ecosystem

According to Charlie Simpson, a way to marry these competing priorities would be to increase coordinated focus on emerging ecosystems. As an example, investment in the next-generation mobility ecosystem, spanning car manufacturers, fleet managers, telecommunications, finance, insurance and cyber security, aimed at the successful development of autonomous cars, electric cars and Mobility as a Service. "If the UK Government defines four or five fields of play where it wants the UK to build particular expertise," he says, "then you could see it playing a valuable coordination role, supporting a series of major sector or cross-sector investments, building supportive ecosystems through tax, R&D, educational and other levers of support."

Building a globally leading, future mobility ecosystem in the UK will require the input of a range of different sectors, forming new clusters of excellence around the UK. Such ecosystems will require greater collaboration between sectors, and between sector and government.

By October 2018, we expect to have a much clearer idea of where negotiations are heading, and the likelihood of a 'cliff-edge Brexit' versus a period of transition or phasing prior to a long-term agreement between the UK and the European Union.

Therefore, there are some really practical things manufacturers need to do now to prepare for the point at which Britain exits the EU in 2019.

## 1 Model scenario outcomes to plan ahead and mitigate risk

Many organisations have begun their scenario planning, and are now looking to build a clearer picture from their data to simulate alternative outcomes come 2019, with the objective of helping them make decisions about tasks they need to do now as well as in the longer term.

Specifically, organisations need to determine how to mitigate a 'cliff-edge' Brexit, i.e. if the UK were to leave the EU Customs Union and Single Market with no deal in place.

these delays as well as short-term increases in demand.

## 4 Keep close to your customers & prepare to support OEMs and exporters

There is increased potential for OEMs to provide supplier finance to customers and suppliers as a result of these cash flow concerns, when banks may be reluctant to provide credit - so keep close to customers. UK centric supply chains should consider how to support customers who are exporters and exports of finished product, e.g. drink, food, and high-value consumer goods.

## 5 Maximise cash and de-risk by reducing costs and liabilities

Take advantage of low interest rates - refinance now to lock in lower cost of capital

Cash flow will slow down due to new processes, changes to indirect tax and delays at country borders. You therefore need to maintain close relationships with your banks to help you maintain financing to meet these delays as well as short-term increases in demand.

## 6 Keep close to your customers & prepare to support OEMs and exporters

There is increased potential for OEMs to provide supplier finance to customers and suppliers as a result of these cash flow concerns, when banks may be reluctant to provide credit - so keep close to customers. UK centric supply chains should consider how to support customers who are exporters and exports of finished product, e.g. drink, food, and high-value consumer goods.

## 7 Maximise cash and de-risk by reducing costs and liabilities

Take advantage of low interest rates - refinance now to lock in lower cost of debt. Manufacturers should consider reducing the burden and inertia of some of higher cost areas now. For example, pensions. Put savings made through cost reduction to good use by investing in training and skills.

Continue to de-risk and reduce draws on cash. Business, government and unions are starting to understand the benefits of discussing these issues now for all stakeholders, including employees, members, businesses and their shareholders.

## 6 Understand the appetite of your market for price changes now

And finally, almost most importantly, anticipate the appetite of your customers for price increases. Start pricing negotiations now. Don't waste a crisis.

## 7 Mitigate supply chain risk

Manufacturing supply chains are often long, complex and span many geographies, lacking transparency. Manufacturers should take steps to review the susceptibility of suppliers to failure and the impact this would have on your manufacturing processes and other suppliers.

## Chapter 6 Conclusions

This survey of the UK facing manufacturing excavates has highlighted several key areas where the UK Government should focus in industrial settings. If the UK is to create a globally attractive and competitive task for advanced manufacturing.

The research quality industry needs to work closely with observations of digital industry, locate the right skills, and sustain any potential flow from front.

The risk is that if these challenges are not effectively addressed, manufacturing and associated industries are also at risk of decline, to the dominant of the UK wide economy. Golibrated European sensors, such as the European industry, government and the automation sector. It is going to be critical.

## 7 Creating up the UK for Industry 40

There is a general consensus that Industry 40 represents an unaccistent opportunity for UK manufacturing, but equally, manufacturers remain aware on front it will affect our own purposes and favor to develop a coherent strategy to make it a reality.

Previous (FUR) operate two remote to the overall benefits to the UK economy from application. However, these will be an inherent unless the government varies in real materials with intensity to ensure that the UK is ready for this identification and the industry's equipped to deliver it.
