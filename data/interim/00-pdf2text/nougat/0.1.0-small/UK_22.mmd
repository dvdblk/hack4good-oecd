## Summary

This paper presents the process and outputs of a skills foresighting project undertaken by HVM Catapult and Enginuity with the support of the Gatsby Foundation. The objective of the project was to identify the future competencies required in the workforce as industrial digitisation technologies are adopted in automotive manufacturing.

The foresight concept arose from a recommendation in the report produced by an international study of the roles of Centres of Innovation and their training networks carried out by HVM Catapult with others in 2018/19. An initial proof of concept activity during the autumn of 2019 focused on aerospace composites technology and a second foresight project was undertaken in the spring of 2020 addressing industrial digitisation for aerospace and automotive manufacturing. (Copies of the reports on both projects can be obtained from HVMC by contacting workforce@hvm.catapult.org.uk). Following the second, cross sector, study this project was undertaken to refine insight into the industrial digitisation competencies required in automotive manufacturing with a particular focus on production and shop floor activities.

The initial step of the project drew upon the expertise of researchers at the Institute of Digital Engineering1 to identify the industrial digitisation technology and capabilities required in an automotive manufacturing organisation. The next step utilised expertise from employers in the Automotive Council Skills Working Group to prioritise technology capabilities and align them to role groups in the future workforce. Additionally, an expert group from education (HE, FE and industry) defined the individual competencies required in the future workforce to deliver the required organisational capabilities. The future workforce competency sets generated were then mapped and evaluated with reference to relevant standards from the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (IFATE).

All the steps in the foresight process were undertaken using on-line/virtual meetings which necessitated the adaptation of existing face-to-face workshop activities and the trialing of a number of software packages including on-line whiteboards, web-based polling and spreadsheets to capture and share information. The project commenced at the end of August 2020 and the employer and educator workshops took place in September and October. Mapping and gap analysis took place in November using the previous manual methods and a pilot Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language Processing (NLP) model. Project review, evaluation and reporting was undertaken in December 2020.

The future competency sets developed for all role groups confirm the need for the following key competencies:

digital literacy, competency with tools and systems to manipulate and analyse large data sets;

programming and use of automated / robotic systems, reconfigure production cells/systems;

product / process monitoring using embedded/integrated sensors, Industrial Internet of Things;

digital work instruction tools and AR/VR systems for production operators/support;

secure access, storage and exchange of digital data.

The mapping and gap analysis step using a range of existing IFATE standards again highlighted that many of the current engineering and manufacturing standards lack digital elements and correspondingly existing digital standards lack specific manufacturing competencies.

## 1 Introduction -

In common with other sectors and industries the UK automotive sector has identified the deployment of "digital" technologies as both a priority challenge and key enabler to ensure competitiveness. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) and KPMG report, Digitalisation of the UK Auto Industry2, outlines the challenges of adopting digital working practices, but also illustrates some of the benefits that can be achieved through sector wide digital working. The benefits of effective digitisation are shown in the graphic of Figure 1.

Footnote 2: SMART Report - [https://www.smmt.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/smmt_the_digitalisation-of-the-uk-auto-industry_kpmg-apr-2017.pdf](https://www.smmt.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/smmt_the_digitalisation-of-the-uk-auto-industry_kpmg-apr-2017.pdf)

The SMMT/KPMG report highlights significant implications for upskilling and retraining the workforce. The biggest barrier, identified by employers interviewed for the report, was cited as equipping their workforce with the necessary knowledge and skills - nearly 50% cite lack of necessary knowledge and skills - Figure 2.

## 2 The Foresighting Process

Why Foresight? - Manufacturing the Future Workforce Report

Working with the Gatsby Foundation, TWI and NPL, the High Value Manufacturing Catapult (HVMC) published in January 2020 the report of an international study of good practice in Centres of Innovation when working with their education and training networks 6. The report concludes that systematic changes are required to ensure the UK develops a skilled workforce able to meet the demands of a dynamic and challenging global manufacturing marketplace.

Footnote 6: [http://hvm.catapult.org.uk/mtfw/MFTWFFull.pdf](http://hvm.catapult.org.uk/mtfw/MFTWFFull.pdf)

A major recommendation is to implement the 'Skills Value Chain' (SVC). The SVC aligns the skills development of the future workforce with the needs and opportunities of emerging and more productive technologies. By involving technology, education and employer groups in a coherent and connected way the SVC delivers value for all stakeholders.

The SVC (Figure 4) approach links technology strategy to future workforce requirements, highlighting where new standards, qualifications and upskilling courses are required for the current workforce using modular training and learning-through-work approaches. It also captures the essential step of investing in those that will teach new content and scale-up provision as demand grows and technology diffusion occurs.

What is the Foresighting Process

The initial step of the SVC approach involves foresighting future workforce requirements by identifying the 'future state' competencies necessary to enable industry to adopt and exploit emerging technology capabilities, such as industrial digitisation. These future workforce competencies can then be evaluated against the known 'current state' and subsequent recommendations for timely action to prevent future skills shortages can be made. The process uses a framework of structured discussions, workshops, analysis and evaluation to propose changes to standards and qualifications as well as future education and training provision at all levels.

Figure 4: Skills Value ChainUsing a common language, taxonomy and syntax

A key feature of foresighting is the use of standardised vocabulary, definitions, language and syntax. As part of the international study tour in 2018 the project team met staff at the Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute in the US, now MxD, who had developed a taxonomy for digital manufacturing7. The taxonomy provides both a reference framework and structured terminology. The value of the reference framework is that it draws upon best practice, reflects leading edge developments and so provides a guide or template for businesses engaging in digital manufacturing by highlighting facets that need to be considered - such as cyber security, clear digital leadership and safe sharing of data with supply chain partners. Additionally, the value of a structured terminology is that it provides a common vocabulary that can be used within a sector and across sectors, expressing sector specific terms with a consistent language and meaning. The foresighting process has built upon the DMDII approach and developed a set of definitions, language and syntax that is consistent but also flexible to cater for varying sectors and industries.

### Foresighting Process Steps

Foresighting uses a systematic approach that is robust, scalable and can be applied across a wide range of manufacturing areas, and sectors and industries. An overview of the steps in this project is shown in Figure 5.

Arising from the insights of the international study tour a key feature of the foresight process is the use of expert groups at each stage of the process.

**Specialist Technologists** - drawn from industry and academia, who will identify technology priorities based on their insight and understanding of emerging and priority technology developments relevant to their industry and sector.

**Expert Educators** - academics, at FE and HE level, who will identify the consequent educational priorities arising from the technology priorities based on their understanding of the knowledge, skills and behaviours that will need to be developed in an individual to enable them to fulfil the roles defined by the expert technologists.

**Expert Employers** - drawn from relevant sector employers and employers' groups to verify that the role groups and competence sets produced are fit-for-purpose across a range of employers in the supply chain - primes, tier 1, OEMs and SMEs.

For this industrial digitisation project, the participants, by group, were -

**Specialist Technologists** - from Institute of Digital Engineering, Loughborough University

**Expert Educators** - 32 educators from HE, FE and employers

**Expert Employers** - 18 employers from automotive sector.

Details of the organisations/employers represented can be found in Annex 1.4

\begin{tabular}{p{28.5pt} p{28.5pt}}  & Whether the workforce tends and driver and whether the Industry Gullspace-related to the underlying technology target \\ \end{tabular}

The underlying challenge facing the UK automotive sector, as with many other sectors, is agility - the ability to adapt and change rapidly to meet emerging challenges. There are many pressures facing the sector including zero-emission solutions, autonomous vehicles, reducing the lifecycle cost of products, servitisation and reducing the net environmental impact (measured by CO2 and other metrics) of products and manufacturing methods. Many of these pressures interrelate and require systems, tools, methods and crucially, a workforce, that can integrate data and information from a diverse range of sources - customers, in-service data, legislation, regulatory bodies and production systems; quickly and adaptively. Digitisation is a key enabling strategy that is critical for the future of the sector.

\begin{tabular}{p{28.5pt} p{28.5pt}}  & What the Gullspace-related by Gullspace-related to successfully addressing challenges in future. \\ \end{tabular}

For UK automotive manufacturing the key capabilities identified by the SMMT/KPMG\({}^{2}\) report are -

* digitally based replications of physical systems that use embedded sensor systems to provide real time data
* predictive analysis using AI/machine learning techniques that can interpret large dynamic data sets
* embedded VR/AR solutions that allow for intuitive interaction between digital and physical worlds
* agile production technologies that can produce directly from digital models, such as additive manufacturing
* cyber secure data systems using Blockchain and other technologies to allow data and IP to be safely shared across the supply chain

\begin{tabular}{p{28.5pt} p{28.5pt}}  & \\ \end{tabular}

Insight from national, sector road mapping and strategic planning was provided by researchers at IDE. This material identified a number of application areas, or scenarios, to provide context for the implementation of the capabilities listed above. These were -

Collaborative Robotics

Vision System

Internet of Things

Predictive MaintenanceAutonomous Logistics

Connected Inventory

Additive Manufacturing Technologies

Machine Learning

These scenarios were used with employers from the Automotive Skills Council to determine and prioritise specific capabilities required in three manufacturing workforce role groups:

Technical Operator

Junior Engineer

Senior Engineer

Incorporating feedback and experience from a previous Foresight project in the spring of 2020 three role groups are used in foresighting align to the Engineering Council descriptors for Engineering Technician, Incorporate Engineer and Chartered Engineer8. Additionally, a four-level rating is used to differentiate between the proficiency required in a role group for each capability. For example - Cyber awareness is a capability that may be required across all role groups within and organisation, but at varying levels of proficiency reflecting roles and responsibilities.

## 4 Recommendations for Action on Training Standards

The insight gained from foresight process was then used to identify and prioriti recommendations for changes in the education and training of the future workforce.

The future competence sets developed were mapped using 25 standards from the IFATE Engineering and Manufacturing and the Digital routeways. The results indicated that existing standards do not align closely with the future competency sets. The highest coverage was for the Level 3 Engineering Technician which was evaluated to cover ~50% of the future competences required. The lowest coverage, ~ 5%, was for the Software Development Technician against the same future competence set. The engineering standards lack a coverage of digital topics as listed above, and correspondingly the digital standards do not cover core manufacturing competences. A summary of the mapping can be found in Annex 1.2.

Additionally, as part of this project an Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning, model was developed by Data Scientists at Enginuity to undertake the preliminary map and gap analysis step. The model built used data from a previous Foresight project in the spring of 2020 with additional data produced by this project. Figure 6 shows steps in the approach taken to develop and apply an AI/ML model for map and gap analysis.

Evaluation of the outcomes from this pilot use of an AI/ML approach has identified a number of refinements for future foresight cycles including the development of a structured syntax for expressing knowledge and skills statements, inclusion of additional data fields in the machine learning model and revising the map and gap process step to adopt a hybrid, expert / machine model, approach.

Figure 6: Enginuity Data Pipeline Process - Source Enginuity-HWMC internal reportFollowing the map and gap evaluation activity the following upskilling gaps were identified for each role group / level.

Technical Operators Level 2/3 - * Interpret and communicate data from metrology/inspection systems using digital tools/methods * Use digital production and process simulation/modelling tools for workflow and process improvement activities * Use and interrogate digital data from sensor systems for WIP/inventory tracking and monitoring * Use digital reporting and management tools for in-company process monitoring, supply chain partner monitoring

Junior Engineer - Level 4 - * Use digital production and process simulation/modelling tools for workflow and process optimisation activities * Editing of machine control software and systems, safe working practices for software/controller systems * Support Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality systems used for work instructions/operator guidance * Knowledge and use of connected equipment / sensor systems to collect and manipulate production data

Level 5 - there were no relevant standards that could be used for mapping at Level 5

Senior Engineer Level 6 - * Design and implement integrated production/process/inventory monitoring and control systems * Implement data intensive, mathematical models of product, manufacturing processes and maintenance systems for improvement/optimisation * Develop and implement digital work instruction / operator guidance tools and systems * Undertake environmental / lifecycle evaluation of production

Senior Engineer Level 7 - * Specify tools and techniques to collect, access, explore, profile, pipeline, combine, transform and store data, and apply relevant data governance (quality control, security, privacy) * Identify and deploy at organisation level appropriate programming languages and AI tools for data manipulation, analysis, visualisation, and system integration * Lead organisation wide process development/revisions to reflect regulatory, statutory requirements - eg GDPR, environmental impact * Develop and maintain collaborative relationships at strategic and operational levels, using methods of organisational empathy (human, organisation and technical)

These competencies are not in the existing standards used for mapping and define the upskilling required for the current workforce, trained using existing standards and qualifications, to meet the future requirements identified.

Additionally, this information can be used by groups reviewing standards, qualifications and existing provision to inform and guide discussion and decisions about topics that need to be included in the future.

At each step in the Foresight process, feedback is obtained as part of the workshop activities covering the outcomes, information generated and overall workshop format/method. Additionally, the outcomes have been shared with the Automotive Skills Council, related Trailbazer group and vocational awarding organisations.

The feedback received confirms that -

The findings and conclusions align with sector, employer and education, expectations

The structured approach that directly links a technology challenge, organisational capability and subsequent individual competence is seen as, effective, valuable and informative

The use of a common language, syntax and method for classifying manufacturing organisations, role groups, proficiency and competencies is welcome as this enables a consistent approach and also sharing of information across sectors

## 5. Review and Evaluation of the Process

This project has demonstrated that the foresight process:

* is a viable approach that links technology priorities to future workforce competencies,
* provides information for the review of existing standards or proposals for new standards,
* can be used to identify the upskilling required to prepare the existing workforce for the future,
* can be undertaken using on-line and web-based meetings,
* offers benefits and value to participants and stakeholders.

The outcomes of the project confirm that the foresight process is effective in linking technology strategies to workforce development priorities. The systematic approach establishes a clear evidential link between a technology capability and the consequent individual workforce competencies required. Additionally, the workshop approach integrates input from a number of expert groups in structured manner and provides participating groups with insight that is richer than at present.

Mapping of the future competency sets against existing reference points; for example apprenticeship standards, provides a mechanism to inform review of these reference points and future requirements. In this project mapping was undertaken using IATE standards but other references, for example qualification and programme specifications could be used. Additionally, gap analysis provides insight about the topics and priorities required for upskilling the current workforce to meet the needs of future technologies.

The DMDil taxonomy was utilised to capture and express the capability statements with technologists and also to guide the educators in developing the corresponding competence statements. Further work is required on the structure, content and use of the taxonomy, but the experience in this project, and feedback from participants, confirms its value and benefit. At the start of the project the expertise of IDE was used to develop and extend the coverage of the taxonomy and this work will be extended in further foresight projects. The DMDil model has a strong focus on capabilities required for designing and setting up digital manufacturing, but does not address a range of operational capabilities - for example Total Quality/ Continuous Improvement. Additionally, the DMDII capabilities do not cover specific manufacturing / production technologies - for example additive layer manufacturing or a specific composite technology such as resin transfer moulding.

The use of'scenarios' i.e. technology demonstrators and applications has been identified as mechanism that can provide participants with the required focus and context in which to deliberate. Given the broad scope of industrial digitisation this is a key feature and will be integrated into the foresight process.

Necessity, in early 2020, forced the transition to an on-line approach for the workshops and discussion sessions. Whilst this created additional challenges, the solutions developed have proved to be effective in enabling the foresight process to become more efficient. On-line working does place greater IT demands on data capture/manipulation tools, requires face-to-face workshops to be divided into shorter on-line sessions and experience indicates that groups of 6-8 are best for securing engagement and contribution. The on-line approach offers greater flexibility for scheduling and requires participants to commit 1-2 hours for a session rather than a half-day plus travel as was the norm before the pandemic. On-line workshops will continue to be used post pandemic for this reason. A critical enabler for the future is the development of a suite of IT tools that would provide faster processing of data and a more consistent approach to mapping and evaluation.

Notwithstanding the caveats arising from the developmental nature of the processes, recommendations from this project will be provided to employer groups for consideration during standards review and to support the development of future standards, qualifications and provision in relevant manufacturing and digital cross cutting subjects.

Foresighting offers benefits for each of the participant groups -

**For Technologists -** The foresight process can provide intelligence about the overall organisation capabilities required to ensure successful adoption and deployment of a technology strategy.

**For Educators -** The foresight process and wider Skill Value Chain approach provides intelligence about the topics, qualifications and upskilling requirements for education ahead of the deployment of a technology strategy.

**For Employers -** the foresight process provides intelligence about the impact on the workforce, both new recruits and upskilling, as a consequence of the deployment of a technology strategy.

In summary the refinements and further improvements identified include:

* improvement of the foresight process to capture the learning and experience of this project,
* a suite of digital tools based on bespoke and existing packages to support on-line participation, manipulation and analysis of the data collected and created through the foresight process,
* the use of scenarios to provide context and focus for participants at each stage of the process,
* further development of the use of a UK specific capability taxonomy and supporting tools,
* further work with other sectors and groups on industrial digitisation workforce requirements.

For a further and extended discussion on the foresight process, skills value chain or specific issues on industrial digitisation please contact work-force@hvm.catapult.org.ukUsing this taxonomy it is possible to both guide the terms used to define a capability and additionally through the taxonomy structure enable capabilities to be clustered and grouped. Using extracts of the DMDII work, a simple look-up table was created in Excel which enables the user to determine the taxonomy definition for an identified capability. Figure 8 demonstrates how a capability - Assembly Simulation - is classified using the taxonomy hierarchy.

### Glossary / Definitions

#### Organisational Capability Statements

- the capability required in a company/business has been expressed using following descriptors;

**Define & Devise** - create new solutions / systems to address new and emerging issues/challenges. Original solutions to new problems - ie create an in-company production system design optimisation tool that uses of AI/Data Science techniques.

**Design & Implement** - using defined processes / tools create and implement solutions in support of manufacturing / production activities. Using established / existing tools and techniques design and implement a production system solution - ie introduce a new product variant into an existing production system/cell.

**Use - Operate and utilise existing tools/workflows/systems on a day to day basis - ie production cell team.

**Maintain** - Support existing / installed systems and solutions.

**Proficiency** - these are used to aid differentiation of the depth/breaking required - for example Cyber Security measures. A Senior engineer responsible for the company network, maintaining the firewall etc would be expected to be an expert and have greater level of proficiency than other role groups. The Technical Operator role group may require an understanding of the threats/issues and know which company procedures to use. In other situations, it is logical that the operator is the expert -using materials handling equipment and other role groups may only require understanding.

#### Awareness

- Basic knowledge, terminology, relevance to sector, industry and company, sufficient comprehension to know where to seek further information/details if necessary, to address a specific issue
- eg SPC
- aware that it is a process used to monitor ongoing quality of a product and/or service, would know where to find more details on company virtual.

**Understands** - Understands what the implications/consequences/impact is for their role/function, know what key actions are required and in what context, e.g. understands need for robust login/passwords and renews login/password details in accordance with company policies and practice.

**Practioner** - Is able to apply and use independently a tool, system or process - for example CAD for the design and testing of parts as part of a manufacturing engineering workflow.

**Expert** - specialised user, with detailed knowledge of process, system or tool. Role requires them to support others, will identify improvements required for a process, system or tool and either commission others to implement improvements, or could implement improvements personally/directly.
