These vision statements may read as common sense, but the system across the area struggles between all parties in the system is critical to achieving this as the status so in the future.

Moving forward This vision for the skills system is a long-term project. The starting point is ensuring that short-term strategic priorities are approached as a step in the right direction towards longer-term change. Focus now and in the first five years will be on the following short-term priorities:

A composite variation in access to education and ranking across Cartologestive and Pet Petrororoquy, there are gaps in **operoperntines for work experience and exposure to role** models that showcase the range of occupational opportunities in the area. The implementation of T Levels coinciding with Covid-19 has added to the difficulty of students able to access work experience as part of their studies.

Without purely given to career education and advice at school and in relt and FE provision, there are gaps in careers guidance, and set and technical skills that employers need. A focus on academic routes at school in combatting with FE and HE providers incrediented to deliver qualifications rather than skills, means that opportunities are missed to upsail young people in Cartologestive and Petroroquy for local jobs and future opportunities.

## Employer access to talent

Of a total population of 880,000, around 405,000 residents are in employment, slightly above the national average at 170% compared with 75%, or those in employment, 12% are self-employed, which is slightly below the national average of 13%. Stigly fewer employed people work pertime at 23% compared with 24% nationally.

The CPRE and the USientific facilities, eighteen, digital and advanced manufacturing as priority sectors for long term, innovation-based growth in the region. However, these sectors account for just 20% of employment overall. Identified in the LERS were a set of recovery priority sectors, requiring focus as significant employers and suffering severe disruption from the pandemic. retail, hospitality and leisure, construction, transport, education, manufacturing, health and care.

Businesses, regardless of sector, are facing a raft of changes to which they are responding- including Covid-19 recovery, mixed of Breach, diffusion and industry 4.0, transition to net zero, and changes and represents on supply changes. These are driving new ways of working and demand for new technical skills from the workforce. The local knowledge and marketing based economy is well posed to improve and build new opportunities around industry 4 and one projects. Still, working needs to both anticipate and respond to the range of changes for sectors and occupations across the area.

There has been resilience in jobs and recovery from Covid-19 with lower than average funding rates in Cartologestive and Petroquy-fit at 4.2% of the workforce compared with 5% nationally in August 2021.

Stu foundational sectors continue to face recruitment demand issues as a result of Covid-19 and Break - for example, retail and hospitality vacancies have fresh by 40.2% and construction by 25% from February 2020 to May 2021. Overall in Cartologestive and Petroquy, job positions in September 2021 were 33th paper among its UK, and the 13% higher than pre-game levels, and higher in every area center (Complete-5% favour).

GWA and employment in the innovation-based growth sectors is strong and growing - maintaining Cartologestive and Petroquyroids role as an economic growth centre. GWA is also growing faster than average in these sectors across the area - at 91.4% compared with 8.0% nationally. Petroquy has the fastest growing GWA at 15%.

However, several productivity areas at sectors has fallen slightly by \(\sim\)1.1% compared with 1.2% growth nationally. Previously has only grown in Petroquy-fit by 7.9%, and huntingproductive by 2.9%. Federal has the lowest productivity and GWA levels in the area, and both are faring by \(\sim\)1.1% and \(\sim\)4.1% respectively, as well as the lowest earnings in the area. The highest productivity levels are driven by manufacturing and in Petroquy and Huntingtonate".

Strong productivity and GWA performance in Petroquy is not following through to stages for residents. There is large disparity in residents' earnings across these area: Petroquy (with French) has the lowest average earnings in the area, at 22.6337 compared with 53.673 in Cambridge and South Cartologestive. The impact of fewer still levels in places such as Federal means that commutates are struggling to benefit from the region's growth, threatening future opportunities.

Employment levels across the area are slightly higher than national average at 75% compared with 75%, but less news late in Ferland, Huntingpostine and South Campologestive. Employment in invention-based growth sectors is rising faster in the area than average at 17.4% compared with 85% nationally. However, the positive growth in these sectors is not experienced evenly across the area - with profitly sectors clustering in specific places, for example, advanced manufacturing in Petroquy, Cambridge and South Cartologestive, life sciences in Cambridge and South Cartologestive.

In Petroquy and The FE, efforts to create new jobs in the area are intrinsically linked to efforts to raise local skill levels. Providing a places' residents with access to higher-level skills ultimately has little or no effect on productivity or addressing local levelling up challenges without also stimulating the supply of higher value, good quality jobs for those residents to go into.

High levels of self-employment in Finland point to a strong entrepreneurial culture, but this is the only place that has more people self-employed than employed in a sector profitised for innovation based growth. Finland's self-employment rate is the only place above national average of 18.7% compared with 13%. This will then overall samples in Finland indicates limited employment opportunities. Finland, Petroleum and Introgotative at have lower recent increases in employment levels, closer to (or lower than) the national average than the CPCA _average_, with much sharper increases in self-employment.

This indicates barriers into work, including lower jobs density levels and reinforces the importance of global creation, as well as training, as an important component of up-sampling in some areas. Friend is the lowest levels of jobs, and East East Cambridge's at 0.74 and Humphforshown at 0.83 have lower jobs density than the national average of 0.87. Petroleum, Cambridge and South Cambridge's jobs currently is higher than average, and Cambridge and South Cambridge's jobs are above 1, meaning there are more jobs available than various age populations.

Travel to work shows on the following map to the left net inflows to Petroleum and Cambridge, and cut offs down from Finland, East Cambridge, South Cambridgeshire and Windforshown. (This data should be created for that it is based on 2011 census data but demonstrates long-term trends). Ferland in particular is not well connected to jobs clustering in Cambridge and South Cambridge, reacting access to opportunities.

The below map to the right net also shows that commuting out of the CPCA area is concentrated in the surrounding areas, with links into London and other major cities, but particularly to the North and east of Petroleum, Eastern, East Cambridgeshire and South Cambridgeshire, into Lionshire, Nordik and Stulkar.

This suggests two priorities - connecting people to places where jobs are concentrated, and creating good jobs where connectivity is more limited.

**Connectivity challenges across the area are illustrated by the below maps, contrasting the proportion of people who travel to work by car or van with the proportion who travel by bus. Bus connectivity into and around Cambridge appears to be wider than around Pet Pet Petrogovich, with real cost spots in Friend, East Cambridge and Nationoidline. The developing OPCRA.Local Transport and Connectivity.** Pain aims to address social local priorities to support the labour market, better connecting people to work and learning.

**Future information and collaboration on recruitment and skills needs as well as provision could be better joined up between employers and providers - including longer-term trends affecting skills demand in future. This would build on the ongoing Growth Works programme, and making the most of Cambridge Angel and Opportunity. Petrogovich networks.**

**The area is a starting to fall behind the national average on higher level skills. The proportion of the working age population outlined up to level 3 is rising at 2.5% compared with all of 0.1% nationally. This could be positive, however, the proportion of people whose highest qualification is a level 2 is also rising against a national test, and qualifications at level 4+ are growing more slowly than average.**

**Currently levels of higher skills are in the win the rest of the UK at 4.9% of the working age population studied at level 4+, but this rate is growing more slowly than average, and there is large variation between places. Rates range from 60% of the working population in Cambridge to 27% in Friend. Rates are rising fastest in Nationoidline at 6.7%. But in Friend, Cambridge and East Cambridge.**

**The occupational structure varies significantly across the area. In Carntologies, 53% of residents are working in occupations at still level 4 (9% which typically require a degree or equivalent period of relevant work experienced), compared with 14% in Friend and with 31% nationally. Areas have lower than average rates of level 3. In Nationoidline, Ferland, Petrogovich and East Cambridge, around 32% of the workforce is employed in level 2 drops (in the winth national averages). Fentanyl and Petrogovich have much higher than average average 1 year (outers at 10.8%, 10% and 17% respectively) compared with 2.7% nationally, levels reflect the five highest employing occupations across the area: sales and retail assistants, administrative occupations, care workers and home careers, elementary storage occupations, and nursery.**

**Across the area, the main skills gaps are in mid-level, still cities, those which require strong work-related and/or technical training. Considering these skills needs, the lower occupational levels, and in employment levels, in places such as Friend, **a drive for increasing higher level skills alone will not address barriers facing residents and the structure of jobs and businesses?**. There needs to also be a focus on growing local businesses, and creating and extracting new jobs to the area, particularly considering the higher likelihood of school reserves entering work rather than continuing education, as seen above.**

**Figure 13. Proportion of people who travel to work by car or van (left) compared with by bus (right) (2011 census data)**Life-wide and lifelong learning and training

With an aging society, people will be working for longer and changing jobs move throughout their careers. This reflects the need for their lower learning as well as lifelong, as careers are becoming less and less infant, while people having a portfolio of jobs and experience throughout their lives. Life-wide also reflects the ability for people to pursue learning in the community and through life experiences outside of dried job-related, or formally delivered training.

This will analyze fading in the economy in the coming years will require a skills system that can respond to local employer peers, and individuals embodies and individual technical and soft skills gaps. Currently, access to careers guidance and advice beyond an educational setting is lacking.

Enhanced life-wide and community learning, and personal development not specifically related to work, provided in a community setting would support this. In 201920, 17% of OFCAAR Education Budget spending was allocated to community learning; and the CA aims in the upcoming commissioning period to allocate 20% of funding to community learning.

Transitions between jobs, employers, occupations and roles will become more important as driving trends play out in the local economy. Industry 4.0 and automation, potentially accelerated by labor students currently being experienced from the effects of Covid-19 and format, are expected to impact policy services in Cambrogosia and Pettenberg. Applied has the highest exposure to automation at 40% of employment exposed, with 43.9% of employment not requesting with other growth sectors. Advanced manufacturing faces 39% of employment exposure, with 33% of digital and 33% for life sciences. These four sectors also have more overlapping occupations in other sectors, ranging from 74.2% to 70.95%. Resalling will be a clear challenge in the coming years, particularly in areas with concentrations of agriculture and manufacturing.

As we turn attention to net zero with national targets set by 2050, and with OFCA coordinating so on operations to becoming net zero by 2030, **Mills and recruitment needs will grow in order to decFigure 15: Prior employment status of CPCA AEB learners by age group (2019/20)

## 4 How we will get there

### Setting a direction

This vision for the skills system is a long term project. The starting point is ensuring that short-term strategic priorities are approached as a step in the right direction towards longer-term change.

In order to deliver on short-term priorities, CPCA will set strategic delivery plans with the new system that will form part of the wider business and Skills Strategy. CPCA will provide and agree with partners detailed action plans, addressing short-term priorities and objectives that will move toward the process of delivering the long-term vision. Progress on these will be monitored and portnets calibrated for using at least one of the studies and throughout subsequent strategic plan.

The detail of the strategic action plans will be developed with partners across the two. In the first, we design respective roles and responsibilities in delivery. These action plans will need to take into account.

* activities/ interventions with the ranked, approved and are either already being defined or which will be delivered over the next few years.
* activities/ interventions which are needed to underpin longer term and future development/program, for which additional exploration, investment and potentially system change will be required.

In the short-term, the following strategies will be key to shaping the local response:

* Assistant, Regional, and international requirements, return plans to incentives, Lifetime Skills Guarantee. This focuses on supporting jobs with direct levels of individuals that work and uptake, together jobs in those sectors that harvest by the pandemic, and creating jobs and turning opportunities.
* "HMT's Plan for Growth (March 2021) sets out the vision for building back better through plans of infrastructure, skills and innovation as they to the UK ecosystem from Covid-16. The development strategies to improve productivity and levels of the UK multi-level messaging high-quality skills portfolio and training, transforming FE. This will in part envisage the development of creative sites and technologies that will shape the UK's future high-growth.
