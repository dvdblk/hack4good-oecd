We have an opportunity to harness the potential of AI to benefit the UK economy and society and ensure that it is a technology we can all travel and rely on.

The UK needs better AI technologies to meet the demands of real-world applications. The nature of AI, which is often context specific, means that novel AI technologies are not only developed by world-leading mathematical and computational science specialists, they are often developed through tackling real world problems in application domains. The UK must also develop the new technologies that will ensure AI is trustworthy and adoptable, including countering bias and embedding human and societal values into AI.

Fundamental research in social sciences and humanities must be joined with technical development so that we better understand how AI is being deployed and its impact on society and the economy. The need for research and innovation activities across technical advances, societal understanding, and application domains, are inextricably interlinked; we cannot invest in one part of the pipeline and expect to optimally realise trustworthy adoptable technologies for the socioeconomic benefit of the UK.

We must also create the right environment in which researchers and innovators can thrive. This means creating the right environment in which we can drive business adoption. It means raising skills at all career stages, building teams, and attracting latent across disciplines and across the UK. It means building a networked and collaborative sustainable UK research and innovation community. It also means ensuring a lack of computing power and poor access to data are not a barrier to research and that researchers and innovators can work across sectors and disciplines on both the national and international stage.

## Introduction

Additional Intelligence will focus on the way we live and work from the way we determine and treat cancer to the security of entire transactions. With the computers can analyze and learn from information at higher accuracy and speed than humans can and ultimately offer capabilities which complement those of humans.

Artificial intelligence is revolutionising our world. It is giving scientists the tools to make new discoveries and to make them more quickly. AI is already transforming health services, including the prediction, prevention and treatment of diseases such as cancer. It is helping towards our work to meet targets for net zero greenhouse gas emissions, giving us the tools we need to feed a growing world population, and improving online security. It is helping businesses boost productivity in internal processes and increasing competitiveness through the development of products and services better tailored to customer needs. It will play a key role in recovery from COVID-19 helping us to tackle the social and economic consequences of the pandemic, and help us avoid potential future pandemics.

Artificial intelligence, commonly known as AI, describes a suite of technologies and tools that aim to reproduce or surpass abilities (in computational systems) that would require 'intelligence' if humans were to perform them. This could include the ability to learn and adapt, to sense, understand and interact; to reason and plan; to act autonomously; and even to create. AI will transform the way we undertake science, across and within all disciplines, how we develop products and services for the market, the way we live, and the environmental impact we have.

Al enables us to use and make sense of data. Its use has grown with the increase in computing power, the rapid rise in the availability of data, and the need to process increasingly large and complex datasets. AI is a general purpose technology that has the potential to transform the way we do things across many different sectors. It is already being used across industry, including in manufacturing, environmental monitoring, crop production, driver-assistance technology, toys and games, and financial trading. Notable recent advances in AI have covered a spectrum of topics, from Alphafold and AI used for drug discovery, to GPT-3 and advances in reinforcement learning and facial recognition.

## 2 UK Research and Innovation

We focused and innovation series in psychology with universities research, operating, neuroscience, abilities, and environment to create the best possible environment for research and innovation to identify. We aim to maximize the contribution of cost of our component parts, avoiding traditionally and efficiently. We work with our many features to benefit cooperation through knowledge about and focus, to sense, understand and interact; to reason and plan; to act autonomously; and even to create. AI will transform the way we undertake science, across and within all disciplines, how we develop products and services for the market, the way we live, and the environmental impact we have.

Al will open up new opportunities in UK businesses; from the creation of new businesses, to the transformation of business models across sectors. It is also an increasingly important tool for the work of government, operation of public services, charities, and other third-sector organisations. However, its full potential is a long way from being realised. The Made Smarter Review suggests that Ali in manufacturing alone could be worth an extra E198.7 billion to the UK economy by 2027\({}^{\text{th}}\).

Al has a clear role to play in the response to COVID-19, as well as rebuilding and recovery from the pandemic, and planning for preparedness for future pandemics and other pertubations.

The growing use of AI in all aspects of our lives, and the potential for it to become a transformative General Purpose Technology, raises genuine public concern about machines replacing people's jobs, automated decisions about us based on biased or misused information, increased surveillance, and manipulation of news feeds and information to influence us. UKRI has a unique potential to explore these issues and to enable informed decisions to be made about how AI should be deployed, by bringing together technical research and development with understanding of the applications and implications of new technology and public engagement and dialogue.

Al is far from being a mature technology, and many of its anticipated transformative capabilities are not yet a reality. The UK must invest in the development of new AI technologies and in skills across academia and industry if it is to fully realise the benefits that will positively transform society and the economy and maintain our competitiveness on the global stage. A key area for accelerating the pace of acceptance and adoption of AI is the development of new technologies and capabilities that are needed to make AI technologies of the future trustworthy. However at the other end of the innovation spectrum the level of UK private investment in AI technologies does not currently meet our levelling up aspirations; research and innovation has a role to play in attracting and enabling this investment, and in defrisking business engagement. An effective combination of UK public and private investment, to both develop new technologies and demonstrate their value across sectors and applications, will be crucial to realising the potential for AI in the UK.

## 5 UK has world-class strengths in AI

According to the venture capital firm MMC, Europe was home to 1,600 AI startups in 2019. Almost 500 of them were in the UKRI. Between 2015 and 2019, four UK AI companies achieved unicom status, a privately held startup company valued at more than $1 billion, compared with only one other company in the rest of the EURI. The UK has world-class strengths across relevant academic disciplines including mathematical sciences, natural language processing, computer vision, applied ethics, law and regulation. We also have legal excellence, a well-developed regulatory system, and world-class industry strengths in fintech, biotech, digital marketing and advertising, and security. Strong clusters of AI and digital activity have already formed around the UK including in Belfast, Edinburgh and Manchester. We can build on these strengths, and the successes of The Alan Turing Institute, to deliver a true national effort in AI research and innovation. A rich UK AI research and innovation ecosystem will include a variety of research structures, and enable interconnectivity and collaboration between adacemia and the private and third sectors.

Much is happening already. The government is committed to increasing UK investment in RBD to 2.4% of GDP by 2027 and public funding for RBD to E22 billion in a year by 2024/25. Its Research and Development Roadmap14 aims to build on support for traditionally RBD-intensive sectors while also putting the UK at the forefront of transformational new technologies such as AI. The government's Industrial Strategy also identifies AI and data as one of four grand challenges where the UK can lead the world for years to come14. The AI Sector Deal, announced as part of the Industrial Strategy, is a E1 billion package of funding from government, academia, and business to support the adoption of AI14. Publication of the government's National Data Strategy, aimed at building a world-leading data economy, is expected in 2020\({}^{\text{th}}\). UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) is already making strategic investments in AI and will continue to do so.

We can drive the discovery of ground-breaking science, help to solve some of the greatest challenges of our age, and support industry to maximise the commercial benefits by bringing together research experts, innovators, those across all sectors applying AI to their work, and ethical and business expertise. And we can help create and maintain an environment in the UK, \(n\) which a highly skilled workforce has the tools it needs to carry out the research and innovation that will transform our world.

## The UKRI AI Review

This document draws upon the output of the UKRI AI Review, a wide-ranging exercise to understand UKRI's current and future role in supporting AI research and innovation in the UK. Our investments in research and innovation ensure that the UK has the capability to meet the societal, environmental, and economic challenges facing us.

This document sets out both the highly cross-disciplinary and cross-sector findings of the UKRI AI Review and, building on these, UKRI's aspirations for AI research and innovation in the UK. It recognises that AI is vital to the UK's future economic prosperity, environmental impact and societal wellbeing, and that UKRI's investment in research and innovation and its power to bring researchers and innovators together is critical to the work needed across sectors and disciplines to bring the greatest benefits to the UK.

The review was carried out by representatives from across all Councils of UKRI working with an external advisory group representing research, industry, and government from across the UK, particularly DCMs, the Office for AI and the AI Council. See Annex 1 for a list of members. We also consulted representatives of more than 300 outside organisations, including universities, research institutes, businesses, industry bodies, charities, and government. The full list is attached as Annex 2. Whilst the input of colleagues from these organisations has been used by UKRI to develop our ambitions for AI research and innovation in the UK and consider our role in its delivery, the individuals and organisations consulted have not specifically endorsed this position statement.

# Alls a significant global opportunity

The UK is a world leader in Al and well placed to benefit. We are home to a third of Europe's Al startups [21] but whilst we are ranked number three in the world in the first global Al index for research, our international ranking for innovation and impact is much lower, demonstrating real potential [18]. UK Al businesses attracted [26]. billion in venture capital investment between 2013 and 2018 - more than double the amount raised by French and German companies combined [19].

The UK ranks third in the world for most highly cited research publications [19]. We have the ecosystem for rapid advances in Al, with key players and research structures including businesses of all sizes, influential government bodies such as the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDIE), and a strong regulatory reputation, sitting alongside the high-performing universities needed to advance research and innovation in Al. This Al ecosystem is complex and interconnected, and collaboration between key players is a real strength of the UK, which has underpinned the UK's leading position. Examples include successful Al startups such as Deepmind having a key role in research and innovation alongside traditional research structures, university spin-outs such as Nozzle.ai working with high profile retailers, and notable businesses such as DarkTrace originating from academic endeavour.

The UK government's Al sector deal, announced in 2018, includes E1 billion of public and private investment in new technologies. However, other countries are investing more: Germany is investing E3.1 billion [19], to be matched by the private sector; France E1.4 billion [20]; China E1.7 billion [21]. Furthermore, public investment in the USA is expected to reach E5.4 billion in 2020.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6298]

The UK must grow support for AI research and innovation and in higherful skills to maintain and build on its strong position. While investment in the right areas will uniteach transaction and attract and attract market market and private investment to the UK. The free Internet 2020 target identified the UK site at the third highest level of international investment in A (GT 8 billion) in 2020. Failure to support AI research and innovation could lead to a full in UK communities and the country missing out on several benefits by foreign capabilities and the opportunity to influence the agenda on essential and critical research and innovation.

## Opportunities exist across business and research

Al will allow us to maximise use of complex data and help us to address global challenges, including feasible a growing global population taking disease keeping an active population fit and healthy and dealing with climate change.

A graphical forecasts can now predict impacts of EI site up to 18 months ahead. The software test facility has increased the accuracy with which scientists can extract the features of plant costs into treatment that ability to identify eco-movement traits and spread in crop breeding processes.

Al is opening new avenues for researchers to analyze data and make groundbreaking discoveries discoveries including new drugs and treatments for disease such as cancer and the development of new sustainable chemicals. It will utilize productivity and economic growth through new products, services that processes in manufacturing and service costs, as well as driving new business media stress all sectors.

Our review has identified significant opportunities across business and science to promote the design development and deployment of AI technologies, including a health environment and energy, sustainable agriculture and food defence and security. (G) construction with observation from space and create industries.

## 10 Experimental use AI to improve services

Socument also has a strong interest in supporting research and innovation in new AI technologies that could transform public services in areas such as education, public infrastructure management, transport, justice, immigration, welfare, location and addressing healthy degrees communities and diseases. Concurrent departments are directly a characteristic law AI can help them to deliver services. New and better AI technologies could ultimately change our approach to relay making and the management and analysis of public sector data and fedially improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public services.

Unceeding the potential of AI

Despite the potential of AI and the UK to attain strengths, the full potential of AI is a long way from being realised, the UK meets better AI technologies with heavy capabilities to meet the demands of realworld applications, and this will require research and innovation.

* richer interactions that allow genuine partnerships between humans and AI systems through user modelling, consideration of human-AI understanding and interaction, and design and development of AI in line with our understanding of human communication, behaviour, and values. This will also need technological development to embed an understanding of societal and institutional structures and cultures to harness human preference, taste, and judgement
* making AI technologies and their outcomes applicable and transferable more broadly across all domains rather than task specific so we can transfer learning from one domain to another
* developing low power consumption computing approaches to manage increasing energy demands of AI technologies that threaten to limit adoption or pose environmental risks
* greater understanding of the mathematical and computational concepts that underpin AI, for example understanding the mathematics of uncertainty quantification and the theory of decision making in deep learning algorithms

## Addressing key applications and challenges

UK AI research and innovation in both academia and industry is world class. The nature of AI means that investment in new applications and ways of tackling challenges is a significant way to drive the development of novel and general purpose technologies. Greater investment in basic research such as in health will drive the discovery and development of new AI technologies. We must also ensure we continue to drive adoption of AI by business and government. We have yet to see the full benefits of AI as it is not being deployed at scale in many places.

Areas of opportunity for the UK:

* **Al for increasing business** productivity, resilience and increased competitiveness across the economy
* **science and research** where AI could allow us to do research differently, radically accelerating the discovery process and enabling new breakthroughs
* **health** where new capabilities for the management, use and interpretation of health data could help to predict and better manage disease, and deliver new treatments
* **environment and energy** where better use of data could help to manage smart energy networks, tackle climate change and deliver net zero CO2 targets
* **sustainable agriculture and food** where more needs to be done to exploit the benefits of a data-driven approach and help small and medium-sized businesses to adopt them
* **defence and security** where demonstrating AI technologies at scale is challenging
* **creative industries**, from understanding and addressing copyright to virtual production and the need to improve data infrastructure
* **application of AI to government policy and public services**, to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of services for the public, and how policy is informed by data to prioritise what works, why and for whom

## Using AI in the real world

Technical development of AI must be joined with research and innovation in social sciences and humanities so that we better understand how AI is being developed, how it is being deployed in the real world, and its impact on the economy, people and society. This needs to include public engagement and genuine public dialogue that directly informs research. This joined up approach is also key to the UK maintaining a strong role in the development of standards and regulation around the technology. We should seek to gather robust and reliable evidence to underpin development of new legal, regulatory and policy frameworks and work with international regulatory partners on standardisation of AI. A strong reputation for responsible AI could be a big competitive advantage for the UK.

## Maintaining the right environment for research and innovation

The UK must develop AI skills across academia and industry if we are to stay at the forefront of research and innovation. AI research and innovation is undertaken across a wide variety of research structures, including business of all sizes, independent bodies, institutes, and universities. The ecosystem is complex, and the UK's environment for AI research and innovation must build upon ways of working from all of these structures, and particularly enable working across research structures for an open and creative UK research and innovation environment.

Researchers and innovators must also be able to easily access and use data and have enough computing power to make best use of it. We need an environment that networks the UK community, recognises the importance of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary working, diversity and inclusion, and international collaboration to AI development.

## People and skills

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:20]

## Fostering business innovation

Al has the potential to create and underpin new advantage industries, and to transform the business models of existing organisations across all sectors of the economy. We must ensure that the environment is right for business to adopt AI and maximise the benefits of its use. This includes ensuring businesses can make the case to invest in AI, have access to data and the skills to make best use it, and that they are able to work with researchers and innovators on new products and services. To realise the potential business impacts, industry and entrepreneur will work collaboratively with researchers and innovators across traditional research structures to develop new products, services, and business models for the UK.

## Access to data assets

The UK has rich data assets but they are not always easy to access and use; this can be a significant barrier to AI researchers and innovators. Many researchers and innovators estimate that up to 80% of time on AI activities is actually spend on activities to pre-manage data. Issues faced by users include data discovery, quality, access, interoperability, portability, sharing, curation, governance, storage, and security. These issues have been explored by others, including the Open Research Data Task Force, the Open Data Institute [28], The Alan Turing Institute [29], HDRUK (Health Data Research UK) [30] and ADR UK (Administrative Data Research UK) [31] but there is more that needs to be done.

## Computing power

Easy and open access to computing power for everyone is essential to the development of AI technologies. We need sustained investment in a range of facilities from cloud, laboratory and department scale through to supercomputing to ensure this is not a barrier to research and innovation. Without this investment in a range of facilities, compute capacity has a potential to become a barrier to AI research and innovation in the near future.

## Collaborating internationally

The UK can only lead the world in AI if it is working on the international stage; all of our activities must enable collaboration, and we should seek international leadership opportunities for important and emerging areas. We must work with international partners in emerging areas of research and innovation where we have strengths, where we have common interests and where we have complementary strengths and resources, so that we can maximise the benefits from worldwide advances.

## Engaging the public

Al will impact all of society in some way. AI is creating new opportunities in every sector but it also raises genuine public concern. There is a pressing need for us to understand the impact AI will have on society and how the public perceive these impacts. AI researchers and innovators need to engage the public directly on AI, from public dialogues to explore directly public opinions and expectations on AI to communicating the benefits and impact of research and innovation being conducted to wider society. This engagement needs to be embedded into the AI research agenda and research process itself.

# Our role and vision

The 20 years we expect AI's potential as a central purpose.

I acknowledge to have been raised with the pervasive affecturing the richness, the economy, safety, the environment, and the way we will live on these UK data to support the UK to have the world feeling. AI research and innovation capability, needed to realize the potential of AI in the UK.

We aim to support the UK in remaining world leading in research and innovation for the next generation of AI technologies. The global marketplace is increasingly competitive. We want the UK to become more attractive for researchers and industry to research, innovative, develop, and deploy AI, and for cooperative action and collaboration to enhance the UKS strengths.

In 20 years, we expect AI to be pervasive - a part of the everyday products and services we use as we go about our daily lives. The public and private sectors will be using the power of AI to better understand UK data assets and make better decisions. It will be driving economic growth, and our workforce - academic, government and industry - will have the skills to reap the benefits across all sectors.

We will be harnessing the opportunities to maximise the societal benefits of AI across the UK and for diverse communities. There will be widespread public confidence that AI is being used in an ethical and responsible way for societal benefit.

Business have matched Innovate UK and EPSRC support with investments of at least E265 million in cash and in-kind contributions. The Catapult network of technology centres, supported by us and by third parties, also play a role in investing in AI and bringing in further private investment. The data above represents a snapshot of the UKRI portfolio of investments relevant to AI Research and Innovation in April 2019.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6309]

sciences to develop capability and capacity in AI across all disciplines and sectors. We must invest in the blue-skies creative research needed to ensure the UK remains at the forefront of global AI research and development.

## 6 Delivering responsible AI

We will work to develop new capabilities and understandings that ensure AI technologies are responsible and trustworthy and designed with an understanding of the real-world context in which they will be used. We will work with partners to deliver public dialogues on AI, its use, its future, its implications and embed public engagement in AI research and innovation. We will seek to bring together technical researchers, humanities and social sciences researchers, and users of AI to design technologies that:

* reflect and support human and societal values
* are designed for user privacy and to limit unjust bias
* are transparent and explainable to those they impact
* are reliable, robust, safe, and secure

## 7 Enabling application-driven research and innovation

We will promote the development of AI to meet specific applications and high-priority challenges, such as the net zero greenhouse gas emissions target by 2050, pandemic response, feeding a growing world population sustainably and keeping an ageing population active and healthy. This will involve helping researchers and innovators to collaborate with those in the public, private, and third sectors looking for solutions to those challenges. We will also play our part in ensuring that researchers and innovators across UK universities, institutes, businesses, Catapults and public sector research organisations are working to their strengths individually and together as part of a single network.

## 8 Developing AI for use in the real world

We will sponsor research to understand the contexts in which AI is being deployed and in the potential societal and economic impacts of its use. A key aspect of this will be bringing together researchers in social sciences and the humanities with technical researchers to create the right environment for responsible research and innovation. We will seek to connect the research and innovation community with key regulatory and governmental bodies and ensure that the UK takes a lead internationally in the standardisation of AI.

## 9 Supporting business innovation

We will develop business innovation support to facilitate the uptake of cutting-edge AI across businesses of all sizes to generate value and jobs in the UK. We will support startups and small businesses working in AI to accelerate their growth. We will seek to:

* help businesses to understand the impact of AI and how to act on their interest
* encourage the development of cutting-edge products and services by supporting knowledge transfer between academics and businesses, for example through Knowledge Transfer Partnerships and collaborative research and development
* encourage greater private investment including by supporting efforts to increase productivity in data engineering and lower the costs to business
* drive adoption of AI across companies of all sizes and sectors by supporting business-led feasibility studies and demonstrators that allow businesses to take their first steps in developing and deploying AI and understanding the return on investment
* support researchers and innovators to bring in social science and creative/design expertise to ensure that user-friendly AI will be adopted

## 10 Developing diverse talent across the UK

We will support the development of skills and talent across research and innovation from early career researchers to world-leading researchers and innovators. This will include seeking to attract, retain, and develop, diverse people and teams; creating a healthy talent pipeline and building our capacity by upselling UK researchers and innovators and bringing in international talent. We will enable inclusive 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:26]

This is likely to include:

* undertaking a review of open research data and practice across UKRI to ensure that UK research is findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable (So FAIR)[21] and as open as possible
* ensuring, where possible, that data generated through our investments is accessible and usable
* supporting provision and creation of data resources
* exploring how key data sets, for example standardised and anonymised health data, can be provided for research and innovation
* supporting innovative new approaches to data storage, sharing, and access
* seeking to make the case for a long-term approach to growing computing and network capacity.

## 5Fostering international collaboration

We will support UK researchers and innovators to work with international leaders in areas where we are strong and that are in line with the strategic priorities of the UK. We will ensure international collaborations are driven both by research and innovation excellence and our expectations around responsible AI.

## 6Public engagement

We will aim to enable UK researchers and innovators to undertake public engagement as part of their research and innovation activities, so that they can request the training, tools and time required to ensure their research is informed by public opinion. We will enable UK AI researchers and innovators to communicate the benefits and impacts of their research. We will work in partnership with other stakeholders to draw our researchers and innovators into a wider public engagement landscape and explore complex aspects of AI via public dialogues.
