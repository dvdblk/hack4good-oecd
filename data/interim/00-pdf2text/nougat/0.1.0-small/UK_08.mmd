## The UK Skills System:

AN INTRODUCTION

This document provides a summary of the UK's Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) system and how it provides the UK economy with highly skilled people. It contains the following sections:

1. WHY SKILLS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE UK

2. WHAT ARE TECHNICAL AND VOCATIONAL SKILLS?

3. ABOUT THE UK SKILLS SYSTEM

4. A FLEXIBLE, HIGH-QUALITY SYSTEM

5. ABOUT THE BRITISH COUNCIL - CREATING GLOBAL LINKS

For the UK to seize new opportunities and grow, we need a trained and diverse workforce, supported by good business practice and the right policy environment.

## Chapter 1 Why Skills Are Important to the Uk

People and skills are the heart of the UK's economic prosperity. Equipping everyone with the right knowledge, skills and behaviours sets them up for sustainable work and progression, supports social mobility, promotes a more equal society, and means businesses can seize new opportunities that drive growth and productivity. It is vital that employers have the workforce they need to enable them to grow and prosper in a global economy; employers and learners need skills and training provision to be both relevant and of high quality.

## Chapter 2 What Are Technical and Vocational Skills?

There are several definitions of'skills'. In this document, we are concerned with the skills required to perform effectively in the workplace.

As can be seen from the diagram below, being effective at work is more than just having the technical skills for a specific job role. Combinations of different skills link to each other to form several'skills'. "Core'skills such as literacy and numeracy are vital underpinning skills, whilst "employability' skills are often seen by employers as just as important as technical skills, particularly for customer facing jobs.

Defining the particular mix and level of skills needed for effective performance in each industry and occupation, and keeping this up to date, is an essential part of the employers role in the UK skills system, Employer groups work together to define 'Standards which capture the unique combination of knowledge, technical skills, attitudes and behaviour for each occupation in their sector of the economy.

Helping people to acquire such a wide range of skills is complex, and is not easily taught entirely through traditional classroom teaching. Therefore public and private learning providers in the UK often work directly with employers. This offers learners a mix of practical learning in the workplace, simulated work environments, project, and team based activities aa well as online and classroom based learning. This helps people to have the skills, knowledge and practical experience they need to meet the appropriate standard.

These include: _teamwork_: problem _solving; initiative_: planning and _organising_: entrepreneurial thinking_: self-management and learning_.

## Chapter 3 About the Uk Skills System

This section explores who delivers TVET in the UK, the structure of the system and how it is funded.

### 3 WHO DELIVERS SKILLS IN THE UK?

Across the four nations of the UK, Skills are delivered through a range of organisations within the TVET sector. The main organisations delivering skills are:

#### 3.1.1 Employers

Many employers now provide on and off-the-job training opportunities, often through apprenticeships. Training is normally directly related to the job role and the needs of the organisation but is also broad enough to ensure that learners have the ability to work in their chosen industry for other firms. Leading employers also provide their established employees with the opportunity to update and enhance their skills.

### 3 Independent Training Providers

These organisations deliver a range of skills but usually with a focus on the vocationally specific elements. They support employers in developing apprentices in the workplace and also deliver broader employability skills training.

1.2 In practice, independent training providers, colleges and employers often work in partnership to provide support for learners. Typically, training providers will directly support those employers who want to bring in external expertise to help them manage their training. The provider often organises and assesses the "on the job" training provided by the employer in the workplace and may co-ordinate with a local college to provide technical learning "off the job".

#### 3.1.3 Schools

Which deliver a range of core skills and some vocational courses, particularly for learners aged 14 to 18.

#### 3.1.4 Universities

Alongside academic and higher-level vocational and technical skills, universities also deliver core skills and have an increasing focus on enterprise and employability. Learners usually start higher education aged 18.

# STRUCTURE OF THE TVET SYSTEM

In the UK, several organisations work alongside learning providers in delivering skills provision. The diagram below explains how they link to each other in relation to public sector funding and gives further information on how they work.

###### Contents

* * Employers purchase apprenticeships through the training levy system.
* * Employer Representatives include Sector Skills organisations, National Skills Academies and other employer organisations.

## 1 Collaborative provision:

Recent innovation in TVET has included encouraging a range of new collaborative arrangements between learning providers to offer alternative learning environments for young people aged between 14-19. This has included the development of

* University Technical Colleges (UITCs) which offer a new concept in school based education for 14-19 year olds. These give students the opportunity to study at an institution specialising in a certain industry and equipped to a high standard. They are sponsored by universities and directly linked to industry. They deliver an innovative, high-quality education that combines technical, practical, and academic learning. In doing so, they offer students an alternative to the traditional GCS and A Level curriculum, UITCs focus on applied learning in science, technology, engineering, and maths.
* Career Colleges are separate trusts established within FF colleges, with sponsorship from the Edge Foundation and Helping Hands, to offer a highly practical vocational and technical education designed to equip young people with the skills to enter a career in a specific industry.
* National Colleges are centres of high-tech training aiming to ensure the UK has skilled people in industries crucial to economic growth. These will focus on industries such as high speed rail, nuclear, onshore oil and gas, digital skills, and the creative industries, as part of an E80 million public investment by government. See case study below on the National College for High Speed Rail.
* A number of charities such as The Princess Trust, The Sainsbury Foundation and Business in the Community provide innovation support to schools, colleges and individual learners.

# Tvet: Different Approaches Across the Uk

The UK is made up of four nations: England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The UK Parliament is responsible for policy in England while the Scottish Government, Welsh Government and the Northern Ireland Assembly have a wide range of devolved powers, including over skills policy. In practice, they are similar TVET systems, but devolution has led to some interesting differences in how skills development is delivered and supported:

* [label=*]
* England: has introduced a training levy on large employers to fund increased and reduce the number of its colleges. It has established and has an integrated careers service model. It has pursued a policy of of government, providers, and quality modern apprenticeships. These schemes typically last three years and are focused on specific provision with borrowing powers and freedom to act commercially provided they protect public money. Government has encouraged a process of collaboration and merger in order to improve longer terms financial stability and enhance the learner experience.
* [label=*]
* National College for HIGH SPEED Rail

The National College for High Speed Rail will offer a wide variety of courses, all developed with leading employers, meaning students will be gaining the exact skills the industry needs. The courses will be taught through a mixture of hands-on classroom learning, using the very latest technology, and real work experience on real projects. The College will be opening its doors to a first intake of industry professionals and apprentices in September 2017, with courses for students aged 18+ starting the following academic year.

## 11 Devolution of Skills Powers to Local Economic Partnerships (LEPS) and Nations

There has been an increasing trend of devolving traditional UK government powers to nations and regions within the UK. TVET policy in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales has continued to diverge with differences in emphasis between apprenticeship systems, greater consolidation of FE Colleges and variation in the adoption of new models of collaboration such as UICs and National Colleges.

In England, Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEP) have increasing influence over sub-regional skills policy, funding for adult skills development and capital expenditure. LEPs are led by employers who work in partnership with local government and other economic and social partners. In parallel, local government across the sub-regions where the largest cities such as Manchester, Birmingham and Sheffield are located, have come together to agree wide ranging economic development strategies with the national government. These include substantial employment and skills action plans linked to local labour market information, facilitated by a growing range of devolved powers.

# How the Tvet System is Funded

Tvet in the UK is funded mainly by government funding bodies - particularly to support the full or part time learning of young people under 25 years old and some specific adult learning. Colleges and Training Providers also receive income from fees for further and higher education programmes including where individuals have taken a government learning loan to pay for their studies. Colleges in particular also generate extra funds from income earned from employers for apprenticeships and for commercial activities such as tailor made training for employers and consultancy. Funding mechanisms vary in each UK nation, as well as in relation to the age of the learner.

Funding is used to influence quality and priorities as it:

* [noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
* Is used as a policy lever to deliver educational strategy. The Government processes funds on those areas that it sees as most important and wishes to influence. Currently in the UK this includes extra financial support for young people under 24 to get their first qualification, meeting providers are expected to look for innovative and enterprising ways of generating income and reducing costs whilst maintaining quality.
* is increasingly demand led: The Government in England has introduced a training policy on larger companies across the UK to ensure business pays a fair share of training costs. The levy is held in an electronic account with Government and can be drawn down to pay for training and assessing apprentices taken on by the business. Small companies receive a grant to

EXCELLENT LEARNING PROVIDERS

As noted above, different types of learning provider operate in the UK. To deliver the skills that employers need in a manner that learners expect, all learning providers need to have the following attributes:

## Chapter 1 Exploring Linkes between Education in Wales

Cogley Cymped and GE Aviation have worked together for more than 30 years. This cooperation has seen both parties benefit and grow as a result, and provided jobs for many learners over the years. At the heart of the partnership is an apprenticeship programme, providing aircraft engineers to GE Aviation. The apprentices bring fresh talent and enthusiasm to the factory that provides engine overhead services for the aerospace industry. The apprentices who are the employees of the future are trained in the skills needed by the company to secure future overhaul work. The College also engages employers to join it's governing body and the industrial and commercial experience of the governors benefits the development of the curriculum.

## Chapter 2 Exploring Linkes between Education and Industry in Northern Ireland

The Innolc Centre was set up by South West College in Northern Ireland to nurture the growth of technology and innovation in local companies. The centre has since become a neus between industry and education using the skills of its staff to match companies with students with specialist expertise in science, engineering or technology. It provides opportunities for training, technical mentoring and project management for small local businesses among to adopt new technologies and embed innovative approaches.

The centre is supported through input from Sector Skills organisations, local comucels, regional enterprise development bodies and universities. To date, Innolc has successfully generated over 200 real-world scenarios for students to work on in partnership with SMEs as a means of preparing them to enter the world of work. It has also generated in excess of E11 million for the regional economy.

## What Qualifications Do Learners Study

In the UK?

Qualifications are available at all levels in the UK from very basic to higher degree level. In the UK, universities develop and award foundation degrees, bachelor's, and postgraduate degrees. Further education colleges focus on vocational qualifications below degree level, but also deliver some higher education courses including degrees, usually in partnership with universities.

\begin{tabular}{l l} Government-appointed education & The role of these awarding bodies is to. & Unlike other countries, awarding bodies in the UK are independent organizations \\ bodies accredit awarding bodies so that their qualifications are recognised as part of national qualifications & Identified need. The need might be: & and operate in a competitive market \\ frameworks.

\begin{tabular}{l l} Country assure and standardise \\ the qualifications. \\ \end{tabular}

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2545]

## Rigorous Qualifications

Learning providers must have effective systems in place to ensure fairness, accuracy and consistency when delivering, assessing and quality assuring regulated qualifications. Requirements are set by the awarding organisation that offers and awards the qualifications. These requirements differ depending on the purpose of the qualifications. Awarding organisations are, in turn, accountable to the qualification regulators, to ensure that the different quality assurance requirements of each qualification meet national standards.
