Summary

X Jobrelated training is an important routine addressing skills gaps, improving UK productivity performanceand transitioning to a research economy light of the economic shock caused by Covid-19, the need to reor upskill the workforce is now even moreacute due to rising unemployment -felt particularly for younger workers, or those with lower levels of educational attainment.

X In an international comparison, participation in related training in the UK is relatively high, however, there appear to be issues with respect to the quality of training. A higher share of the UK workforce is underqualified for their occupation compared to other advanced econotheresid significant room for improvement in training and distilling activity.

X Despite the observation the last two decades have seen a general decline in the participation in job relatedtraining, as reported by workers. This decline impelsimost to the young, high skilled and highly educated workforce who historically received training compared to the rest of workforce. Lower skilled workers have consistently receivedry low levels of training. There has also been a decline inthe amount of training received by those who are trained.

X While data on publicly funded training particular apprenticeship shows thatthe number of participants has expanded increment years the share of older apprenticeship increasesand there are concerns around the decline in the duration of apprenticeships.

X Similarly, the investment made informs on training has fallen in recent years, and firms prefer to address skills shortages with recruitment rather than on the job/gaini

X Since the Covid9 crisis, there has been a sharp decline in job related training for those in employment, and this has been higher for younger, less educated individuals.

X The trends outlined in this paper and the broader evidenseggest that new or enhanced policies to increase the quantity and quality of updated training are required, particularly for youngerkers or those with lower levels of educational attainment increased support readout education and training announced since the onset of Covid-including the National Skills Fund, and sharing incentives for apprentices are welcome. The evidensegests that further action across the following four areas would be effective terms of increasing employer provision of related training

O Human capital tax credits: These can help incentivise businesses to invest in training their workforce. Such mechanism could be piloted in specific areas where displacement has been particularly acute, or where significant change is anticipated in the future (e.g. greening the car industry)

O A more broadly defined Apprenticeship Levy Reforms could be considered to more effectively target younger workers and to broaden training investments covered by scheme.

O Further devolution of skills policy: Increased devolution of apprenticeship and training policy should be considered where local knowledge of skills gaps and opportunities can increase its effectiveness.

O Job creation and retraining schemes:Embedding reskilling or upskilling in new programmes of job creation, including those associated withenediinvestments with stronger incentives for businesses and support for individuals.

## Introduction

Human capitals a key inputfor economic growth(see, for example, Hanushek and Woessman, 2015) Beyond the crucial role of formal schooling in building human capital, a substantial fraction of investment takes place through jedicated trainingand this has been shown to be an important contributor to wage and productivity growth (see for example,denet al., 2008andKonings and Vanormelingen, 2015). Moreover,job-relatedtraining is a key mechanism for improving labour market resilience(onchanging skill demand in response to economic shocks and broadends such astechnological change globalisationed the transition to netro carbon emissions.

Given therisks that trained workers can beacled, and the presencef human capital externalities which mean that firms canniternalise all of themefits of their investments in trainifigms tend to underinvesh training their workforce Improving the UK's skills basevas urgently needed even before the Covid49 crisis hit. Skill shortages have been consistently reported by businesses and contribute the UK's ongoing poor productivity performance compared to its main international peers (Valero and Van Reenen, 2019; LSE Growth Commission, 2013, 2017). And the spatial distribution of skilled workers explains the large part of the largescale dispersion wages across the UK (Gibbons et al., 2013), suggesting that improvements in training are likely to be central developing-up' agendaHowever the data show that decent years have seen a general decline in the UK, in terms of participation (AminSmith et al., 2017) and volumes (Green et al., 2016), with further falls in participation in recent years documented by Mountford and Wadsworth (2019),addition, there are also long-standing concerns about the quality of vocational education in the UK (Wolf, 2011; Musset and Field, 2013; Hupkau et al., 2017), especially in light of recent budgetary pressures. According to official figures, government expenditure on jedicated trainingexperienced a 18%all in real terms compared to 2010 level (Britton et al., 2020).

Addressing these issues become ever more urgent as part of the policy response to the Govists: the pandemic has prompted changes in consumer spending pattebusiness practices and working arrangements(Barrero et al., 2020) many of which are likely to persist beyond the crisis with implications for the demand for certain occupations or skillsterms of the immediate impacts of the crisis skilled workers and those working in leauge in-personservice sectorse less able work from home (ONS, 2020). As a result, workers in louaid sectors and occupations have experienced the largest losses in employment and earnings (Adafieassl et al., 2020) with the selfinployed being hit particularly hard (Blundell and Machin, 2020). Young adults have also suffered disproportionately in terms of labour market impacts of Covid9 (Elliot Major et al, 2020).To the extent that labour market displacements create longer term scarring, these patterns are likely to exacerbating labour market inequalities and damage social mobility (Elliot Major and Machin, 2020). Going forwards, targeted workforce training programmes can help to facilitate the adoption of new working practices, and transition displaced workers into new occupations or sectors where demand is growing.

The training needs of the workforce need to be considered in the context of broader trends which may be accelerated in the current context. Lifelong learning, reskilling and upskilling are emphasised as important mechanisms to ensure that wakes enable to adapt to technological change including the rise of AI and robotics.In a report for the Industrial Strategy Council, McKinsey (2019) highlighted the largescale expected skills gaps over the next decade, with estimates that 9 out of 10 workers will need some form of reskilling. Across industries, the deployment of automation has been accelerated since the

Similarly, the UK ranks only 27in terms of the share of trainees who strongly agree that their training has helped to improve the way they work (chart not reported here). This point is consistent with previous findings that UK training expenditure per employee is much lower than the average (Social Mobility Commission, 2019).

Other data suggest that the shorter training observed in the UK cannot be explained by the UK workforce being in less need of training. According to the OECD Skills for Jobs database 27% of the UK workforce are underqualified for their occupations, compared with an OECD average below 19%. While shortages in STEM are often cited, there are critical shortages across a range of skills, knowledge
