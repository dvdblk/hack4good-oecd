**The UK's workforce is undergoing a fundamental transformation: competition for talent is fierce, while rapidly accelerating automation and technological advances are changing the way many companies work. Career paths are becoming less linear, with a growing need for retraining and lifelong learning.**

As the needs of employers evolve, so too must the education provided by universities to ensure students gain the skills and experience needed to succeed in a modern workplace - and ensuring that they can adapt as new opportunities and challenges arise. Highly-skilled graduates remain in demand by employers and, with research showing the number of graduate vacancies in 2021 was 20% higher than in 2019, the need for graduate-level skills is continuing to grow. Across the UK, every year, our24 universities already teach four out of five doctors and dentists, a third of all engineers, as well as 15,000 nurses and over 5,500 teachers.

Russell Group universities have a proven record of offering high-quality education across a range of technical, vocational and academic disciplines, with teaching from world-leading experts in their fields. Our students learn how to innovate and work independently, developing robust critical thinking skills and studying in a vibrant and diverse environment.

This ensures our graduates leave university with the knowledge, skills and broader experience required by employers so they are ready to work. **This is demonstrated by the fact that in 2019/20 more than 80% of working graduates who studied at a Russell Group university were in a highly skilled job 15 months after graduation.**

Our universities deliver excellent education in the social sciences, humanities and creative disciplines, as well as in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), to produce talented innovators that fuel our growing service sectors and creative economy.

The education offered by our universities is a unique mix of strong academic foundations informed by the latest research whilst also ensuring a close link to the needs of employers and industry.

Our universities are working with education partners at all levels.

Whether it is providing materials for schools, training teachers, helping prospective students understand what university is about or even setting up their own schools and academy trusts - Russell Group universities are dedicated to giving young people the best start in life.

We understand that some students may require more time to develop their knowledge and confidence before undertaking an undergraduate degree. That is why many Russell Group universities offer high-quality Foundation Years in subjects such as medicine, dentistry and allied health professions to give students the time to adapt to being in full-time education, which often attracts students from more diverse backgrounds.

Making education more accessible is not just about young people. Our universities are already innovating to offer more flexible courses so people can access learning at different points of their lives, develop new skills and boost their careers. Often these courses are delivered through long-standing partnerships with local Further Education colleges.

Our universities specialise in research- intensive education, informed, co-designed and delivered by world-leading researchers.

The unique learning environment at our universities enables students to learn from leading experts in their field and become active participants in the production of new knowledge and innovations. This generates a dynamic system where research and teaching can directly benefit from each other. A recent survey by the British Academy highlighted the value students place on their lecturers embedding the latest research into their teaching materials. Our ambition is to produce graduates who can help develop new solutions to the most complex local and global challenges.

Our universities provide outstanding facilities from science laboratories to state-of-the-art libraries, collections and cutting-edge technology to ensure students are learning in a practical setting.

It also means students can see the real-world application of research whilst studying, and benefit from the very latest knowledge and thinking in their discipline and beyond. The impressive breadth of disciplines offered at Russell Group universities provides exciting opportunities for novel interdisciplinary work.

Over 90% of research at Russell Group universities has been rated world-leading or internationally excellent.

Students at our universities directly benefit from being a part of this community and can contribute to advancing knowledge, including undertaking their own research and inquiry during their studies, becoming researchers in their own right, and taking these skills into the workplace.

Russell Group universities provide a key ingredient for the Government's plans to deliver growth: a pool of well-rounded graduates with the skills needed to propel leading sectors and grow new ones, driving innovation, creativity and productivity. After completing their studies at a Russell Group university, a graduate will be able to think critically, analyse and solve complex problems, and bring ideas and teams together. All these skills will help to ensure they are responsive to the needs of employers in a constantly evolving labour market.

Our universities are also nurturing successful entrepreneurial talent.

**Start-up businesses run by Russell Group graduates attract around five times more external investment, have a higher turnover and employ more people than the average UK graduate start-up.** Their ventures are more likely to survive and grow into successful businesses long term.

The **University of Oxford** facilitates around 1,800 global internships for its students each year. These innovative internships, hosted in partnership with SMEs, charities, research institutions and multi-nationals, offer experiences in all sectors including entrepreneurship and social enterprise, sustainability and the environment as well as technology, data, machine learning and AI. The internships are designed to accelerate students' professional and research skills which they can apply beyond their degree.

## 4 Addressing skills

gaps to deliver UK

economic growth

### Russell Group universities are helping to address

specific skill gaps in key areas needed for the future

growth of the UK economy.

The need for data skills will only increase as automation and new technologies are adopted widely around the world. Last year, Government research identified between 215,000 and 234,000 roles being recruited by UK companies that required hard data skills. Our universities are well placed to respond to this need with nearly two thirds of maths graduates and six in ten graduates with physical sciences qualifications, disciplines with a great emphasis on high-level data skills, having studied at Russell Group universities. But equally, we are also teaching key data handling and analysis skills in disciplines such as humanities and the social sciences, creating a deep pool of transferable skills for our graduates.

Digital skills are another gap in the UK workforce that our universities have a key role to play in closing, with estimates suggesting the current skills gap costs the UK economy as much as E63 billion a year in potential GDP.

Digital learning and online tools are already being used at our universities to enhance teaching and learning. Our members will continue to incorporate new techniques into course development so students are receiving a high-quality and 'future proof' education. All students, no matter what their discipline, will leave our universities with the essential digital skills they need to succeed in the workplace.

The ground-breaking research and innovation nurtured on our campuses is a magnet for business and industry and means our universities are well-placed to build partnerships with employers to anticipate future changes in employment needs. Building on the success of existing innovation clusters, our members are taking advantage of links with business and regional leaders to create additional high-value jobs and kickstart our economy. Working closely with employers is crucial to ensure all of our courses - from higher technical qualifications to degree and postgraduate level - meet the needs of employers.

By equipping graduates to succeed in high-value sectors, our universities play a critical role in driving economic growth: a single cohort of UK-domiciled students at Russell Group universities is estimated to contribute more than \(\ell 20\) billion to the economy over the course of their working lives, including \(\ell 1\) billion in tax and NI contributions.

Our most powerful asset to address UK and global challenges are our students. One of the greatest global threats is the impact of climate change. **All students at a Russell Group university are given the opportunity to learn about environmental sustainability so that future generations can help tackle the issues caused by climate change.**

Programmes like the University of Edinburgh's Futures Institute are innovating in this space, combining education from STEM and social sciences, arts and humanities (SHAPE) subjects to foster interdisciplinary skills needed to tackle climate change. The Government's Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution aims to drive \(\ell 100\) billion of private sector investment by 2030 and support 480,000 green jobs in renewables by the end of the decade. It is our ambition to ensure graduates have the technical skills and knowledge to progress into these jobs, drive societal change, support the UK's place at the heart of the green economy and live more sustainable lives.

**Leaving school or work to study at university can be both exciting and challenging. Our universities are dedicated to supporting students to make that transition so they can thrive, while enhancing the'soft' skills employers value such as resilience and adaptability.**

Students at Russell Group universities benefit from a range of support as they transition from post-l6 education into degree-level study. **This includes dedicated pastoral support for students as they move away from home - often for the first time - so that they can learn to be independent, thriving in new, challenging environments.**

**Section 6**

Conclusion Education

for the future

As educators responsible for teaching a quarter

of all UK-based graduates our universities have

big ambitions for the future of education.

Our universities are constantly re-assessing their models of education

to ensure every student can meet their potential. A student's

pathway needs to be individualised to their own learning needs, with

expanded routes into flexible and lifelong learning. The frameworks to

provide a coherent pathway for students taking individual modules,

building toward a final award, should be sector-designed.

**The intensive, skills driven education provided by Russell Group**

**universities demonstrates the value of sustainable, long-term**

**investment in high-quality higher education.**Russell Group universities will continue to build on their local, national and international partnerships to ensure their courses are always informed by the latest research and expertise and are responsive to the changing requirements of employers and the skills needs of their regions.

Students will be given more opportunities to engage critically with course content, applying their knowledge to real-life issues. Innovative assessment will become an even more important part of the learning process, with student, academic and employer reflection on the best ways to test and reinforce the skills graduates will need. Learners will also benefit from different forms of assessment with an enhanced focus on collaborative and multidisciplinary learning, building critical skills such as teamwork, analytical thinking and leadership.

Digital tools will play an increasingly prominent role in enriching education. This will include the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in learning and assessment which will bring both challenges as well as opportunities. The coming years will be a key moment for universities to consider the ethical considerations of using AI and to identify how best to harness the benefits of this technology and embrace change whilst ensuring academic rigour.

Thinking about the future of education requires imagination but also the appetite to accept an element of risk. Our universities will be ambitious in creating academically stretching, increasingly flexible learning opportunities and course curricula. We will continue to anticipate the needs of the future, delivering world-class education to more diverse cohorts than ever before.
