# Essential Digital Skills 2022: Technical Notes

Essential Digital Skills Methodology

Sample

Ipsos interviewed 4,099 participants aged 18+ years in the UK (Great Britain and Northern Ireland) via their telephone Omnibus. Data are weighted to represent the UK population in terms of age, social grade, region and working status within the gender variable and additional profiles on tenure and ethnicity using PAMCo data. Data are further weighted on device ownership using data derived from arbobustnational survey.

#### Fieldwork dates

13th April-13th May 2022

#### Fieldwork methodology

The Ipsos telephone Omnibus (also known as CAT(BUS), was used for a second year as the methodology for the Essential Digital Skills (EDS) study. CATIBUS interviews a nationally representative sample of those aged 18+ in Great Britain. An additional sample of interviews in Northern Ireland (n=150) was then conducted to ensure UK representtivity, CATIBUS uses telephone interviewing to ensure no online bias, with responses entered directly into an electronic questionnaire by the interviewer conducting the interview.

The sample design incorporates a range of variables to ensure a robust, representative and consistent sample is achieved each week of fieldwork. CATIBUS uses a rigorous sampling method - robust samples of telephone leads are purchased from specialist sample providers as well as Random Digt Dialing, and consumer sample lists of over 10 million people in the UK which can be targeted locally and nationally. Approximately 60% of interviews are conducted on a mobile and 40% via landine.

Only a limited amount of corrective weighting is needed to adjust the results on the Omnibus survey so that they are in line with the national demographic profile.

Between 2019-2020, Ipsos conducted the EDS survey through the face-to-face Omnibus (CAPIBUS) which was able to reach those aged 15+ in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic compromising the safety of participants and interviewers and prompting local lockdowns throughout the UK, the survey was carried out by telephone for the first time in 2021, rather than face-to-face interviewing. Questions were asked in the same way. CATIBUS is now the chosen methodology for the EDS survey for the foreseeable future.

### Caveats to changing framework

The Essential Digital Skills report is based on data collected to help understand if people would be able to do a range of tasks without assistance in either a work setting or in their personal lives. These are grouped into 6 questions: Foundation, Communicating, Handling Informationand Content, Transacting, Problem Solving and Being Safe and Legal Online.

In previous years (2019-2021), to achieve the **Foundation Level**, you had to be able to complete all of the seven 'tasks' included in this question. To achieve any of the skills in a 'Life' context you only needed to be able to complete one task from that skill question in your personal life, but you also must havehad the Foundation Level. If youhad all 5Life Skills (as well as the FoundationLevel), you were classed as having 'Life EDS'. Across all 5 Skills there were a total of 29 Life tasks. If you were employed, for each of the Life Skills you had achieved, you were then able to achieve the equivalent work skill question, by being able to complete one task from that skill question by actively using that skill within your working environment. As with Life EDS, if youcould complete all 5Work Skills then youhad achieved 'Work EDS'. Across all 5 Skills there were a total of 17 Work tasks.

In 2022, the Essential Digital Skills calculation and list of tasks within the framework were updated to reflect more accurately the current technological landscape and opportunity for digital activities. The number of tasks for each level has now been updated such that the Foundation Level has 8 tasks; across the 5 Skills there are 26 Life tasks; and across the 5 Skills there are 20 Work tasks.

For the Essential Digital Skill calculation, pre-requisites have been removed at the 'Life' and 'Work' levels.

Achievement of the Foundation Levelis calculated by a respondent being able to do all eight of the Foundation tasks.

Achievement of Life EDS is calculated by a respondent being able to do one task from each of the five Life skill areas and is no longer dependent on achieving the Foundation Level.

Achievement of Work EDS is calculated by a respondent being able to do one task from each of the five Work skill areas and is no longer dependent on achieving the Foundation Level and Life EDS. Unlike last year, participants do not have to be employed to qualify for being able to do Work tasks This year, all participants who are not retired (known as the labour force sample) are eligible for doing Work tasks. Creation of this labour force sample group is defined by working status, and not age. This sample consists of participants who.

* Have paid job: Full time (30+ hours per week)
* Have paid job: Part time (8-29 hours per week)
* Have paid job: Part time (Under 8 hours per week)
* Not working
* Self-employed (full time)
* Self-employed (part time)
* Full time student
* Still at school
* Unemployed and seeking work
* Not in paid work for other reason
* Not in paid work because of long term illness or disability

Thus, the criteria for being able to do a Work task has also been updated. In previous years, participants had to be actively doing the Work tasks at their place of employment to be calculated as doing that task. In 2022, participants are instead classified as doing the task if they cand it, regardless of if they do it at work or not. This provides a new opportunity to capture a group of the population who are not employed but can still do a Work task, allowing Work skill to be measured for UK adults who are out of work and potentially job seeking on the scale used to measure ability to do a task, participants are now classified as being able to do a task if they code 2, 3 or 4 (whereas between 2019-2021, participants had to code 2 or 3).

1. Yes - you can do this task in your personal life
2. IF EMPLOYEDYes - you can do this task in your working life /IF NOT EMPLOYED but NOT RETIREDIYes - you would be able to do this task if you were in work [EXCLUSIVE]
3. IF EMPLOYEDYes - you can do this this task in both your personal and working life /IF NOT EMPLOYED BUT NOT RETIREDIYes - you can do this task in your personal life and would be be able to do this task if you were in work [EXCLUSIVE]
4. Yes - you can do this task in your working life but you don't need to use it
5. No - you can't do this task [EXCLUSIVE]
6. IF NOT EMPLOYED BUT NOT RETIREDI Unable to consider a working life [DO NOT READ OUT - DO NOT CODE WITH 2-5]

As the framework for Essential Digital Skills has changed, any 2022 data collected cannot be compared to EDS results reported in the years 2019-2021. Thus, there is no trended data in the 2022 Essential Digital Skills report.

UK Representivity and Population Estimates

This report includes the numbers of adults 18+ that have been inferred to be in a particular group by extrapolating from our research data (for example, the number of those 18+ in the UKwith all Foundation tasks is 80% which has been extrapolated to represent estimated 42.7mpeople). Total population figures are taken from the most recently publishedestimates provided by the Office for National Statistics (2020midyear stats for the UK). For the Essential Digital Skills data, percentages are applied to a population base aged 18+ (52,890,044). Total working population figures are taken from the most recently published estimates provided by the Office for National Statistics (2020 midyear stats for the UK), weighted to the Labour Force Survey stats ( Labour Force Study) Jan-Mar (2022). For the Essential Digital Skills data, percentages are applied to a working population base aged 18+ (32,596,000). Sources can be found below:

Whilst every care has been taken to ensure the robustness of our data, our data accuracy is limited byits sample size, and therefore there is amangition error that exists around any figures reported.All significance testing is calculated at the 95% confidence level, with the 95% confidence level to be used for all population extrapolations. This means that the population size of any group supplies in a range which has been calculated and included in this set of appendices. For example, it is reported that 80% of UK adults (estimated 42.7 million people) have all Foundation tasks; however, the true populationvalue will be 41.2 with a 95% confidence interval. Thus, there is 95% confidence that the correct figure is between 41.8 million and 43.1 million.

### Impairment classification

The following question was asked to the participants in the survey to establish whether a participant claims to have any impairment:
