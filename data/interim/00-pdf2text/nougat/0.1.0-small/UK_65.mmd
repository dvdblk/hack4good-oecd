Artificial intelligence

in the United Kingdom:

Prospects and challenges

Briefing note

Prepared for London Tech Week, June 2019, in collaboration with

QuantumBlack and McKinsey & Company UK and Ireland

June 2019

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are pushing the frontier of what machines are capable of doing in the private, public, and social sectors.[1] These technologies have already diffused into many businesses and sectors, and they have the potential to transform operations and business models, eventually powering higher productivity and growth across economies.

No other country comes close to the United States and China, the world's powers in the deployment of AI, but the United Kingdom is one of Europe's leaders.[2] In this briefing note, we build on previous research on AI globally and in Europe. We explore the prospective benefits to the economy and companies that could result from scaling up AI, and we outline the priorities for businesses in the United Kingdom that seek to reap those benefits.

AI could be a significant driver of productivity and GDP growth for the UK economy

McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) research has found that, despite transitional challenges that need to be managed, AI technologies can have a significant positive impact on productivity and economic growth and can offer broader benefits for society, such as improved longevity and health.[3] The United Kingdom is already recognised as a leader in technology for health.[4] The United Kingdom also leads in Europe for the density of AI startups launched in the areas of health and medical technology; indeed, the government is attempting to scale up the opportunity by launching a "grand challenge" for better medical research and for improved diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases.[5]

Nevertheless, these are early days for AI adoption, and there are questions about how large the potential could be and what portion the country is likely to capture in economic gains and beyond.

Attempting to predict the economic gains available from AI, let alone trying to estimate its potential effects beyond GDP, is a highly speculative undertaking. On potential economic gains, adoption and diffusion will depend on many variables including technical feasibility, development costs, labour-market dynamics, talent capabilities, and even societal acceptance.[6] With that caveat, MGI's simulation of the global potential impact suggested that AI could add approximately an incremental 16 percent to global output by 2030.

For the United Kingdom, the effects could be slightly larger because it is potentially more AI-ready compared with the global average--although we note that the country still has to scale up its AI effort based on its relative digital assets and competencies.

MGI research has found that leading countries in Al adoption, mostly developed economies and China, could capture an additional 20 to 25 percent in net economic benefits compared with today, which is between two and five times as much as the upside for weaker foundations for Al adoption. We note that the Al frontier does not stand still--there is no fixed point to aspire to reach, because the world's Al leaders and others are constantly shifting their goals. The United Kingdom's opportunity for a productivity and growth boost from Al could quickly shrink if it does not nurture the potential of the technologies. The Al gap between Europe and the frontier (represented by the United States) has already increased by 20 percent in the past three years.[10]

For companies, we are seeing fast movers win big and those that move slowly lose out:

* **Front-runners**, defined as companies that fully absorb Al tools into their organisations over the next five to seven years, could increase economic value (economic output minus Al-related investments and transition costs) by about 120 percent by 2030--implying additional growth in cash generation of about 6 percent a year for the next 12 years, according to our simulation.
* **Laggards**, who adopt Al late or not at all, could lose about 20 percent of cash flow compared with today based on our simulation. A McKinsey survey found that late and non-adopters of Al reduce their employment and investment more than other businesses.[11]

Looking at particular sectors, we find similar non-linear patterns.[12] In professional services and retail, companies that do not deploy Al are reporting that cash flows generated from digital businesses are 15 to 20 percent lower than those of their Al-embracing peers. In financial services, the gap is 30 percent, and in high tech, a substantial 80 percent. Those figures may vary from country to country but are of a similar order of magnitude for the United Kingdom, according to our research.

McKinsey's 2018 Digital Survey found that European companies that had already invested in an Al technology had been able to increase top-line growth 1.2 percentage points faster, and earnings before tax and interest 2.0 percentage points quicker, than companies that had yet to invest in Al. Furthermore, European companies that are already fully invested in all Al technologies--a small sample--are increasing their top line 5.0 percentage points faster than are companies that have yet to adopt any Al technologies, and 3.5 percentage points faster than companies with only a partial diffusion of Al. If this pace were to continue for about the next ten years, the difference in labour productivity between fully Al-savvy companies and average European companies may become as large as 15 to 20 percent if companies also adjust their employment, according to their responses to the survey.[13]

The United Kingdom is in a stronger starting position to capture the AI dividend than Europe as a whole but still has challenges to tackle

The United Kingdom has taken some bold steps to prepare itself for the Al revolution with the support of government backed by parliament. An independent 2017 review commissioned by the UK government, the Hall-Pesenti Review, which was published in October 2017, recommended that the Alan Turing Institute become the national institute for Al and data science; that universities should reduce delays and barriers to commercialisation of intellectual property; and that there should be collective coordination and negotiation to improve access to low-cost computing capacity for Al research. The review also recommended setting up an Al council to promote the growth and coordination of the sector as well as a programme to support public-sector use of Al.[14] The House of Lords Al select committee welcomed government activism on Al and backed the key recommendations of the Hall-Pesenti Review.[15]

The United Kingdom's strengths in the relative science and its policy leadership on Al are reflected in its position on Al capabilities. The ability to capture the full potential of Al varies significantly among sectors and countries, and the United Kingdom is currently ahead of the EU-28 pack on MGI's Al Readiness Index.

The relative readiness of the United Kingdom is the result of its position on seven Al enablers. Three are Al-specific: research activities, startup investment, and automation potential. The other four are foundations for Al: digital absorption, innovation foundation, human capital, and information and communications technology (ICT) connectedness. In the MGI index that covers the United States and China--the world's Al leaders--and the EU-28, the United Kingdom is in the top quartile and ranks high on most dimensions (Exhibit 2).

Although Europe has a large pool of developers, many more are coming from the United States, and 16 percent of these are coming to the United Kingdom.[7] This could suggest that if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union in the wake of the 2016 referendum on membership, it may continue to attract talent.

In 2017, 20 universities were offering more than 30 graduate programmes in AI. The number of PhD enrolments almost doubled to just under 400 between 2013 and 2015.[8] Another strength in the United Kingdom is that it has more science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) graduates than any other country in Europe--more than 60 percent more than either Germany or France, according to UNESCO data.

Nevertheless, like most countries, the United Kingdom faces a shortage of people with advanced technological skills as demand for those skills is expected to increase significantly (Exhibit 4). Jobs profiles characterised by repetitive tasks and activities requiring low digital skills may decline from about 40 percent to near 30 percent of total employment by 2030, but nonrepetitive activities and those requiring high digital skills could rise from about 40 percent to more than 50 percent. MGI has simulated that around 13 percent of the total wage bill could shift to categories requiring nonrepetitive and high digital skills.[9] A report by employment website Indeed, which has assessed job postings since 2015, found a very large rise in demand for people with skills in AI and machine learning. In 2018, the number of AI roles advertised in the United Kingdom was 1,300 out of every one million, double the share in Canada and 20 percent more than in the United States.[20] Europe is already experiencing a shortage of the advanced skills it would need to capture the growth potential of AI while preserving jobs. According to data from the OECD's skills database, the United Kingdom and other European countries have significant shortages in advanced cognitive and technology skills.

The centrepiece of the government's support for the sector is a $1 billion package to support the development of AI in both academia and business. A new AI Council will establish 20 AI Centres of Doctoral Training in UK universities from October 2019. At the same time, industry-funded AI and machine learning MSc sources will be established in universities that already have a strong track record in AI research. For example, McKinsey & Company and QuantumBlack together with Amazon and Rolls-Royce's "R2 Data Labs are supporting a new AI master's programme due to launch in 2019.[21] Another plan calls for establishing MSc conversion courses for non-STEM students to work in AI by 2020.[22] More than $400 million has been committed to research support in AI.

These initiatives are welcome, but more can be done. Consider China's efforts to promote the development of AI. The government aims to create a domestic AI market of one trillion rennibi (E1T5 billion) by 2020 and become a world-leading AI centre by 2030. The private sector is pushing actively for AI, too. Three of China's internet giants--Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent--as well as Fjlytek, a voice recognition specialist, have joined a "national team" to develop AI in areas such as autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and medical imaging. China is developing homegrown talent. According to the Ministry of Education, 35 universities have received approval to set up four-year undergraduate AI-related majors. Chinese universities are promoting an "AI+X" interdisciplinary approach and will have put in place 100 majors that combine AI and other subjects by 2020.[23]

**The United Kingdom has strong academic foundations but is struggling to turn those into business and commercial success**

The United Kingdom's startup ecosystem is supported by a number of top AI centres in universities including Cambridge and Oxford, and technology clusters in, for instance, Brightton, London, and Reading. Venture capital funds in Cambridge (Cambridge Innovation Capital and Cambridge Enterprise) and Oxford (Oxford Sciences Innovations and Oxford Technology and Innovations Fund) have been active investors in AI startups. In November 2018, the University of Oxford announced that it would receive more than $17.5 million in government and industry funding to develop AI healthcare applications. UK Research and Innovation is investing $10 million in the National Consortium of Intelligent Medical Imaging.[24] Oxford University researchers have also received funding from the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund of UK Research and Innovation to explore how AI could help make insurance, law, and finance more efficient and globally competitive.[25] A small number of research institutes are now focusing on AI, including the Alan Turing Institute in London and Cambridge-based Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, which brings together three UK universities--Cambridge, Imperial College, and Oxford--with the Leverhulme Trust and the University of California at Berkeley. However, their number is far smaller than the comparable figure for China, for instance.

Exhibit 4

**The United Kingdom has a skills shortage in advanced cognitive skills, as do several other European countries.**

Net demand in 9%, ie, positive numbers imply skills shortage

This research ecosystem has helped bolster the United Kingdom's ranking in research. Today, it ranks third worldwide in the number of published research papers, according to Scimago. However, it lags behind the United States, for instance, in patents issued. In a report on AI, the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence of the House of Lords noted that the United Kingdom has struggled to turn research into business and commercial success, including in the case of AI, and recommended that universities use "clear, accessible and where possible common policies and practices for licensing IP and forming spin-out companies".[26]

### Organisations in the United Kingdom can play a part in the solutions to scaling AI successfully

The paradoxical challenges to scaling AI that we see in the macro UK landscape are reflected at the company level. If organisations unlock their own productivity and scale through AI, while at the same time developing a burgeoning ecosystem of talent and partnerships to sustain them over the long term, the UK economy will be the ultimate beneficiary. If companies are successful at scaling up AI and reaping productivity benefits, this will give the government tangible reasons to believe in the power of the technologies and understand what they can achieve. This could encourage even greater investment in AI capabilities by the government that will then filter down to the private sector--helping to create a virtuous circle. We highlight three specific areas in which UK companies should act.

**Push beyond experimentation to deliver impact from AI at scale**

Many organisations are facing the challenge of "experimentation fatigue" in their AI efforts. They have invested time and money, but AI has not moved beyond the proof-of-concept stage, and therefore businesses are not seeing returns on their investment. In cases where AI adoption has been a success, we observe four key characteristics:

1. **Aligned C-suite vision.** To deliver scale, companies must be prepared to make big, bold decisions at the C-suite level to maximise AI's potential throughout their business. The effort requires the right mindset and leadership at the senior level. Recent research showed that in more than 60 percent of companies that had successfully scaled AI, executives had aligned on a clear analytics vision, compared with 28 percent of their peers.[27]2. **Clear identification of business problems to solve across the value chain.** Companies that have started to have an impact in AI diffusion have owners who have personally identified business problems to solve and, at the same time, have sponsored change and driven it throughout the business. In successful companies, the business and technical teams have agreed on the critical business problem, or the use case to solve, before any application of data science begins. The breakthrough to scaling has come when the technologies have been implemented across the entire business value chain. Adopting point solutions and failing to connect each use case to a broader strategy is likely to miss the potential of a larger shift in the company's operating model.
3. **Investment in change management.** Data analytics is a team sport, and that team includes change and process managers. Technical experts are often acting alone in silos, disconnected from the main business. When this happens, the models developed seldom meet business and user needs, and are not supported by the interventions required to deliver business change. In particular, no holistic business case and plan are prepared that include explicit actions on change management. Ultimately, while the models themselves may be good, their impact is likely to be minimal.
4. **Rollout of a replicable protocol.** Given the interdisciplinary nature of teams and the potential for use cases across the value chain, it is critical that teams are adopting similar processes and ways of working. Companies should invest in designing a protocol that becomes the boilerplate for running AI projects, which includes activities, deliverables, and risk mitigation strategies for each team. This ensures that best practices and lessons are disseminated smoothly and become the foundation for generating scale.

### Invest in both new and existing talent

Organisations attempting to achieve scale are often held back by a lack of talent in both numbers and skills. The C-site needs to champion recruiting based on a deep understanding of what talent is needed and when, together with a clear and acute focus on retention. Competition for talent is already fierce, and workers with the right skills know they will always have options and be in demand. Offering anchor hires a pathway of career-long continued learning is one aspect of a value proposition that could retain and motivate talented people to stay long-term.

Valuable hires should also be offered interesting and meaningful work, provided with the right tools to do their jobs effectively, and enabled to establish connections within a community that can learn and grow together.

Regular company-wide training and interdepartmental learning are critical to ensuring that many different new types of talent can work together in a seamless way, adopting new protocols and enabling smart and fast development at scale. Cross-company collaboration could also create innovative pathways to compete for the best talent.

Crucially, companies should not confine their efforts to whom to hire now. It is just as critical to look to the future and to the networks and associations companies can create for themselves that will bear fruit in five, ten, or 20 years.

It is also not sufficient to hire data scientists to conduct experiments and then leave them without partners in the business. When this happens, companies often miss one of the most critical emerging roles--a translator. As the name suggests, the translator is someone who can speak the language of the business problem and the technical solution, who fully understands the business issue in question and ensures that it is accurately turned into a mathematical solution, and who is then responsible for translating the answer back into value for the business.

Companies often assume that people with this combination of capabilities have to be hired from outside, but the best translators often come from within the organisation. Existing employees often make better translators than new hires because they have an important quality that is hard to teach: knowledge of a business domain where analytics will be applied. Ideally, translators will have spent time working in business operations before starting translator training.
