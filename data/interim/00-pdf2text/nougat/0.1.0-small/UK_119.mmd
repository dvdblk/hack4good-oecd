## Executive summary

Greenhouse gas emissions have increased substantially since the Industrial Revolution, causing average global surface temperatures to rise to about 1.0\(\,\)C above pre-industrial levels during the last hundred years (PICC, 2018). The effects of the climate crisis, including figina sea levels, population displacement and extreme weather, are already being experienced around the world. Underfitting is commitment to tackling the climate crisis, the UK has set a target of near-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The path towards achieving net-zero emissions requires a significant reduction in emissions over the next decades across all the sectors that produce them.

A transformation towards a greener economy in the UK will lead to significant changes across sectors and occupations, which could increase inequalities between individuals, industries and regions.

The shift to green growth will be a significant challenge for regions with a major concentration of 'brown sector' industries; and for individuals currently working in these industries, while regions with a major concentration of green sector' industries will flourish. Although jobs may be lost or transformed in the brown sector, the 'greening' of the labour market will create new jobs in the green sector that could produce employment gains and prevent net job losses (10, 2015). However, it is not clear which industries comprise the green sector of the brown sector; these categories can include different industries in different countries at different times (10, 2011). Recognising that the opportunities and risks vary by industry, a new taxonomy - the 'Cro-Transformation of Industries Matrix' - has been developed to quantify and gain insights into the level of risk for each industry and the related implications for employment and resulting in the UK.

This report provides a thorough examination of the scale of the challenge in the UK regarding employment and audit learning and offers guidance about the actions needed to achieve an efficient, inclusive and fair transition to a net-zero economy. Based on data from various sources and data analytics, the report will:

* Classify industries in the UK based on the 'Eco-Transformation of Industries Matrix'.
* Assess the impact of the green transformation on the labour market.
* Examine the role of adult learning in supporting a successful green transformation.
* Provide policy recommendations for a smooth transition to a green economy.

The transition to a net-zero economy is likely to have a significant impact on employment and could result in sectorial disparities.

Followers and laggards, or the brown sector, are responsible for about 93 per cent of UK emissions and accounted for 45 per cent of total employment in 2018. Individual sectors and transportation and storage account for about 90 per cent of total emissions. Leaders and neutrals, or the green sector, are responsible for 77 per cent of UK emissions and account for about 55 per cent of total employment. The net impact of the green transition on employment will depend on the number of new jobs it will create in the environmental goods and services sector (EGSS). However, employment in this sector is rather small, accounting for just 1.3 per cent of total employment in the UK.

## 5 Reskilling and upskilling need to include every individual.

About half of all employees in the UK are likely to experience an elevated risk of displacement or job transformation. Male, younger and lower-educated workers are over-represented in these sectors. These workers will need to learn new skills to move from being precautions to being prepared. However, participation in adult learning is not distributed equally among individuals. The participation rate of leader employees in adult learning is about 21 per cent, compared to only 11 per cent for laggard employees. To increase participation in adult learning, learning must fit individual needs, characteristics, preferences and habits. For the UK to reap the benefits of a green economy, regional and national institutions must provide the right conditions for investment in an inclusive and fair adult learning system.

The cross-sectorol end regional dimensions of the transition are critical.

The shift to green growth will be a significant challenge for regions with a major concentration of laggards and followers, while regions with a concentration of leaders and neutrals will flourish. Regions in industrial transition - including Northern Ireland, the East Midlands and West Midlands, where about 50 per cent of jobs are with laggards and followers - will require the most support and strategic development to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels and invest in environmental activities.

A deliberate set of policy actions needed for the UK to unlock the potential of the green economy. There is no silver bullet solution for helping the people most affected by the transition to the net-zero economy. It will require using data more consistently so that workers and students understand what career opportunities to pursue, particularly when it comes to jobs that will grow of disappear under a net-zero economy. Learning from Nesta's work, the UK should support upselling and explore how a mission-oriented approach could help tackle of the biggest issues in the green economy workforce transition. Finally, skills policy must not work in isolation but support inclusive innovation more broadly, ensuring businesses have the skills support needed to develop and adopt eco-innovations.

In previous centuries, economic growth has largely come at the expense of the environment. The amount of carbon dioxide - the primary greenhouse gas, accounting for more than 80 per cent of all greenhouse gases and the main contributor to the climate crisis - in the atmosphere has increased since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1975.

In this study, the effect of the climate crisis are already being experienced around the world.

Underlining is long-term commitment to tackling the climate crisis, the UK amended the pre-existing target of the climate Change Act (2008), which was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions' by 80 per cent from 1990 levels by 2050, setting a new target for 2050. The transition to sustainable development by the ac catalyst for each industry and the unprecedented opportunities and challenges: maintaining existing industries, encouraging the development and expansion of new industries and even destroying existing ones.

Although jobs may be lost or transformed in highly polilities sectors, new jobs in the **green sector** are routine dimensions in the presence of the technical artifact that accounts the inherent net to losses (ILO, 2015; GECO, 2017). However, the green sector and **brown sector** are theoretical concepts that only provide an abstract consequential of one part of the economy, and they can include different industries in different countries at different times (ILO).

Understanding the relationship between environmental transition and industry is critical in order to affect a country's ability to develop well-functioning labor markets and encourage the emergence and diffusion of a new period of growth.

This report develops the "Eco-Transformation of Industries" Married, inspired by the International Labour Organization (ILO, 2011), to quantify the level of risk and opportunity for each industry and offer a richer understanding of the ways in which industries and regions are influenced in the context of the net-zero economy. Using the UK government's definition of the **green economy** as one based on * [10] The taxonomy allows us to: measure current employment within the green economy at a sector, regional and national level; identify inpainities between individuals, industries and regions, and highlight areas in which upselling and re-exclining should be protected. This taxonomy could be used to conduct periodic evaluations of industries in order to identify progress and suggest relevant actions. In addition, education providers could determine which types of workers will face the strongest will face the greatest challenges, so they can provide customised learning programmes to meet learners' specific needs.

Based on the taxonomy, the report shows that green growth will be a significant challenge for regions with a major concentration of high-polluting industries and for individuals who are currently working in these industries. A transformation towards a green economy in the UK will lead to significant changes across sectors and occupations, which could increase inequalities between individuals, industries and regions. The resckilling and upselling of workers are considered vital for an inclusive and fair transition. Adult learning is central to providing opportunities and eliminating barriers for learners she they move towards green jobs. For a successful green transition, the dominant goals of policy need to be supporting industries and regions in their restructuring activities and helping workers to move from a peracious position to a prepared one. The transition to the green economy is a major government priority. Announcements made in the 2020 Budget requesting the importance of the climatic crisis and set out formats to reduce carbon emissions. These actions include: investment in electric vehicles; heat decarbonation in homes and other buildings; carbon capture in at least two UK sites; tree planting; and at least doubling the Energy Innovation Programme to support the research, development and demonstration of low carbon energy, transportation, agriculture and waste. Within the Industrial Strategy, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has developed Sector Deals (directly linked to the clean growth Grand Challenge), which will cost-effectively decarbonise energy while also securing new jobs and growth for the UK economy. Despite the significant measures, more will need to be done to support a green transition, particularly in ensuring a smooth transition for people employed in sectors with high emissions.

While actions to create a net-zero economy imply long-term radical changes to the broader systems in which we live and operate, the forceful, immediate responses to COVID-19 have shown that human societies are capable of transforming themselves overnight (Haley et al., 2020; WEF, 2020), like our response to the coronavirus, we must make fundamental changes for the green transition.

This requires global-to-local responses, long-term thinking, science-driven policies and the protection of the most vulnerable individuals (WEF, 2020).

As greenhouse gas emissions have global consequences, actions have already been taken at international, national and regional levels. As a first step in addressing this issue, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (W/CCO) was set up in 1992 as the main forum for international action on the climate crisis. In 2015, the UNCCS international climate negotiations delivered a global agreement - the Paris - aiming to limit the global temperature rise in the 21st century to less than 22.5c, and ideally to only 1.5PC, above pre-industrial levels. The Paris Agreement has already been signed by 195 UN member countries.

Despite these globally co-ordinated actions, there are very large differences in per capita emissions across countries (see Figure 1). The UK has emissions of 5.8 tonnes per capita. Much lower than some other countries with similar standards of living, such as Germany (97.3 tonnes per capita), the United States (16.2 tonnes per capita). Australia (17 tonnes per capita), suggesting that industries, national regulations and technological choices could all make a difference.

Since 1990, greenhouse gas emissions have fallen by 43 per cent in the UK; the most substantial emissions reduction in the G7. However, the effects of the climate crisis have already been left in the UK, as the average sea level in UK waters has rising by around 16cm in the last 1000 years, while average temperatures in England between 2008 and 2017 were around 0.8\({}^{\circ}\)N higher than in the 1970s (Mete, 2018).

The Climate Change Act commits the UK government by law to reducing emissions by at least 100 per cent of 1990 levels by 2050. The environmental transformation will have a major impact on how production is organised and managed, and how it affects labour markets. However, we do not know enough about the impact of a transition to net-zero emissions on different industries and in different contexts.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:14]

Depending on its level of environmental friendliness, each industry can be placed in one of four different categories (see Appendix):

* **Leaders** Industries in this category are the most eco-friendly, as they do not produce high levels of carbon emissions and are involved in activities that directly protect the environment across the economy.
* **Neutrals**: Industries in the "neutral" category produce low levels of carbon emissions but are not involved intensively in activities that directly protect the environment. They are part of the green sector but are not influenced by new climate-crisits policies.
* **Followers**: Although they are producing high levels of emissions, followers are also involved in activities that are intended to protect the environment and could thus create green jobs.
* **Laggers**: Industries in this category produce high levels of carbon emissions and are not involved intensively in activities aimed at protecting the environment.

In the long run, it will be desirable for the followers, laggards and neutrals to become leaders.

The eco-transformation of industries

Many carbon-intensive industries will see a high proportion of jobs lost or radically transformed due to the net-zero emissions by 2050 target, although prices may remain broadly unchanged. Although jobs may be lost for transformed in the brown sectors, new jobs in the EGSS, otherwise known as the eco-thrusty, could produce employment gains and prevent net job losses (10, 205). While it is difficult to predict the number of future green jobs, as they are still at an early stage of development, data can carbon emissions and environmental activity allows the amount of disruption during the move towards net-zero emissions to be assessed across industries (see Figure 3).

The **follower** industries include: agriculture, diversity and fishing; manufacturing; electricity, gas and water supply; construction; and other services. Followers could be viewed as industries that will be forced to move towards structural change within their sector. For example, the agricultural industry is taking action to protect the environment through top management practices, such as improved fertilizer management. Significant progress has also been made in reducing carbon emissions from energy supply, driven by a decrease in the use of coal for electricity generation and a positive trend towards the production of renewable energies. However, with only about 11 per cent of energy derived from renewable sources, the UK has one of the lowest proportions in Europe (Eurotista, 2020). Further dramatic changes are needed to reduce the production of emissions in these industries.

The **lagged** industries include: mining and quarringing; wholesale and retail trade, and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles; transportation and storage; and accommodation and food service activities. These industries need to reduce their impact on the environment. Retailers and wholesalesera, for example, need to start working with farmers, fishes and manufacturers to source products with a smaller carbon footprint, and design better stores to use less energy and deploy more renewables. In addition, accommodation and food service activities need to reduce their impact on the environment. In the hotel sector, for example, the includes waste collection and energy consumption. Investing in environmentally friendly activities could lead to increased employment, while preventing net job losses, and reducing the emissions could avoid potential future penalties, such as increased carbon taxes, or closures.

More incentives need to be given to **neutrals** to make them become environmentally friendly, as impact role is critical to supporting the transition. For example, real estate is central to urban development and also to the creation of an environmentally sustainable future. However, the sector tags behind other industries in its response to environmental challenges, as is environmental activities are limited. To counter this gap, governments could establish long-term policies that provide incentives for investment in green buildings, such as tax assumptions for green employment gains. Neutrals include the following industries: information and communication; financial and insurance activities; real estate activities; human health and social work activities; and administrative and support service activities.

The green economy and employment considerationsThe environmental transformation will change the ways in which production is organised and managed and affect labour markets across industries. The likely concentration of job losses related to the transition to green growth is a significant challenge for any industry and region. It is likely that industries in the bonus lower will face significant changes and employees in that sector may lose their jobs. There may be employment gains in industries that contribute to achieving a sustainable economy, such as industries that are involved in activities to protect the environment. An examination of the current distribution of employment among sectors is critical for the green transition. This section explores the nuances of a nation are country using the Eco-Transoration of Industries Matrix and considers how it will affect industries and regions differently in the UK.

## Chapter 3 Emissions in the UK and employment implications

The possible effects of greening the economy on employment are concerning. The transition towards green growth will potentially lead to a decrease in employment or changes of jobs in the sectors with the largest adverse environmental impacts, but there could also be an increase in employment in the sectors with positive environmental impacts. For example, a tax on \(\cap\)0, emissions will lead to a loss of reduction of employment in coal-fired power stations and the end and gas sector, and other jobs in carbon-intensive industries with the transformed, while new jobs related to the protection of the environment will be created. In this respect, identifying the share of employment in each of the four industry categories will help to identify the sectors that are likely to face the largest challenges and opportunities in the wake of climate-crisis mitigation policies.

## Chapter 3 Emissions across regions and employment implications

1 Emissions per capita vary noticeably across regions. The Committee on Climate Change (CC) has advised that the net-zero greenhouse gas target for 2050 meets the UK's obligations under the Paris Agreement to maintain the expected rise in global average temperature at less than 2\({}^{\circ}\). However, the CC has recommended different targets for different regions based on their respective circumstances: a 95 per cent greenhouse gas reduction by 2050 in Wales, a net-zero target by 2051 Scotland and an-zero target to 2050 in England and Northern Ireland (CCC, 2019ab). Analysis of CO, emissions shows differing differences across the UK. For capita, emissions are higher in Wales, reflecting its greater industrial base compared to the rest of the UK.

Per capita, emissions in Greater London are significantly lower than the average in England, predominantly because of its extensive public transport system and its service-based economy. According the DNS (2019), both the highest and lowest emissions per capita were found in Greater London. The City of London was responsible for emitting 97.9 times of carbon dioxide per capita per year, compared to 2.3 tonnes in Hackney (ONS, 2019). The main factor behind high carbon footprints could be the low population density of the City, but may also be due to people's high salaries. According to Sagert (2019), higher-income individuals are more responsible for the climate crisis due to their lifestyle consumption emissions (e.g. sports cars, yachts and private jets).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3223]

The cross-sectoral and regional dimensions of the transition are critical. The share of employment in the national level, rather than the regional level, two months is not evenly spread across the UK. Regions in industrial transition, including Northern Ireland, the East Midlands and West Midlands - where about 50 per cent of jobs are in high-dimensions sectors - will require the most support and strategic development in the release of delivery of hot resources, reduce their dependence on fossil fuels and invest in the ESSS. London, where about 66 per cent of employees already work in the green sector, will be one of the areas last hit.

The green sector is concentrated in particular regions, leading to regional inequalities. Such inequalities are likely to significantly worsen, with no trend (with more than 20 per cent of jobs are in high-dimension sectors) decoupling from the rest of the UK. In contrast, employment in the brown sector is less unevenly spread across the UK (see Figure 8 and 9). However, it is clear that some regions have a significantly higher concentration of brown jobs, and particularly jobs in the follower category, than green jobs. It seems that disparities across regions in employment are significant and green policies could strengthen inequalities of opportunity.

Although it is most relevant to apply the taxonomy at the national level, rather than the regional level, two months is not evenly spread across the UK, and institutions in the transition, the matrix could be applied to the four nations to identify potential variations. The green sector may include different industries in different nations, depending on different technologies, different employment structures of the spatial distribution of various natural resources across the four regions.

The interest are very large differences in emissions across the UK, particularly in power supply and agriculture, due to the different size of industries. In Northern Ireland, agriculture accounted for about 30 per cent of total emissions, compared to about 10 per cent in the rest of the UK, due to the large agricultural system sector and the high proportion of livestock-based mixing form in contrast, employment in the brown sector is less unevenly spread across the UK (see Figure 8 and 9).

However, it is clear that some regions have a significantly higher concentration of brown jobs, and particularly jobs in the follower category, than green jobs. It seems that disparities across regions in employment are significant and green policies could strengthen inequalities of opportunity.

The industrial structure of a given region can influence the size of its emissions. Some studies and regions could suffer if appropriate policies are not put in place to mitigate the effects of this major structural change. Therefore, the government should make a broader assessment of potential ways to ensure that the overall transition promotes inclusive growth and creates jobs across the country. While BELS has played an important role in reducing emissions since it was formed, for example by leading the Clean Growth Strategy, such action needs to involve all government departments and agencies, to ensure that emissions are reduced across all regions and sectors, and that investments support those employees who will be most vulnerable during the transition (CCC, 2019).

Shifting the economy towards less polluting and more resource-efficient activities by 2050 will lead to significant changes in jobs and skills requirements. These changes 'translate to new skill sets, updates of curricula or even new qualifications'.

We must determine which types of workers tend to work in each category, in order to identify suitable retraining services that could help them readjust to new jobs of industries and minimise the resulting adjustment costs. Figure 10 shows that 68 per cent of workers in the leaders category are health-silled employees, compared to 27 per cent of the leaders, while the majority of low- and medium-skilled employees is in the brown sector. The share of older workers (55-74 years) across the most and least polluting industries was comparable, while the share of younger workers (up to 39 years of age) was higher in the brown sector. This difference suggests that many younger workers still see brown jobs as viable and in some cases necessary career paths.

In addition, the majority of employees in the brown sector were men, unlike the green sector: 74 per cent of all employees in followers were men, while only about 40 per cent in neutrals and leaders were men. However, the diversity of employees across these sectors differs in a few instances. For example, workers in some of these sectors are mainly older workers (e.g. agriculture), underlining the need to avoid a one-size-fits-all approach.

Current participation in adult learning is a strong predictor of future learning (Smith et al., 2019). However, current participation in the UK is low and varies considerably across the four jobs. The participation rate in leaders is about 21 per cent in laggators, compared to only 12 per cent in laggators. Adults with the lowest qualifications, especially men in routine and manual jobs (laggard and follower industries), are the least likely to learn these skills. Training is more drastic available to start who are already highly skilled, in leader and neutral industries. The concentration of lower- and medium-skilled workers and younger and male workers in the brown sector has important implications for the expected size of the upcoming industrial transformation through upselling and re-selling. Employees displaced from these sectors could face difficulties reintegrating into employment, as lower-qualified workers tend to experience large post-displacement difficulties (OECD, 2012). Learning new skills will be necessary to reintegrate these workers into the labour market.

As Chapman (2020) states, "Learning should not be a linear activity, or exclusively for those who have money or spare time. For everyone to thrive in work, training needs to be re-imagined to ensure learning with individuals needs and circumstances." There are many different kinds of adult learners and they have many different learning needs. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, and is it still to examine potential ways of increasing participation in upselling and resulting by different types of learners. It is crucial to adapt the design approach of a learning experience according to the characteristics and needs of individual learners, including migrants, young and older workers, and low-skilled employees (Casabueas & Bekar, 2020).

The transition to green growth and preparation for future skills demands needs (Bakhshi et al., 2017). Therefore, transition to green growth and preparation for future skills demands will need to be facilitated, alongside other megatets.

As only 11 per cent of people in in _aggard_ industries - the least environmentally friendly industries - participate in adult learning, their skills are more likely to become obsolete over time (OECD, 2019). To gain a greater understanding of _lifelong learning_, also referred to as adult learning (for adults aged 25-64), and address the challenge of upsliding and reselling. Nesta has designed Fourier (it a training and research project) in partnership with trade unions, researchers and adult learning experts from across the Nordic and Renewable regions. Although this programme involves training for many workers in many different sectors, it can still inform decision-makers about how to empower at-risk employees with the skills they need for tomorrow and how to evaluate 'what works.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:35]

The transition to a green economy will not happen without government support. Whether it is the low cost of solar panels driven by the US government (Karak et al., 2018) or the low price of offshore wind driven by the UK (Department of Energy & Climate Change and Hendry, 2012), major progress towards developing a cleaner future has had direct and deliberate government involvement at each step. For the next step of the transition to a net-zero economy, we must look beyond innovations towards other drivers of change to boost the UK's competitiveness throughout the eco-transformation. To ensure individuals and regions are not left behind as the net-zero transition accelerates, upselling, suggestions and targeted support are needed. Developing the next generation of clean technologies and green businesses will require people with the right skills.

A data-driven approach to upskilling

All levels of government need to take a data-driven approach to upskilling, using data to inform individuals and guide educational institutions. Some of this data is already available, but it needs to be used consistently and a co-ordinated way throughout the pipeline of skills programming. This point applies to data that is used for guiding students and workers, like the National Careers Service or the rich job service. Having an integrated place for this information would simplify things for people throughout their lives. It could also include code-badges, so that people know which jobs actively fight the climate crisis or are less likely to be disrupted by a net-rererere transition. Nexists 'data-driven skills taxonomy can help students, workers, employers, educators and policymakers learn more about the skills that are needed, and the value of those skills (Djumatieva & Steeman, 2018).

## Chapter New approaches to upskilling

Non-traditional education, or non-formal education (education delivered by independent private or non-profit educators), can offer a quicker and cheaper route to upsailing individuals. Employees use these routes for times more than further education colleges or higher education institutes to train their employees (Stillis Commission, 2015), Unfortunately, the government does not provide the same level of support for people pursuing non-traditional education, which may limit the effectiveness of upsailing support and create unnecessary burdens for upsailing. New skills will be required, not only for existing occupations that are expected to experience significant employment growth or a significant decrease due to the generation of the economy, but also for other occupations that are likely to undergo major changes in task content, such as legal professionals. New types of credentials and ways of approaching upsailing may be needed. The government worked with stakeholders through the Sector Deals to develop T Levels, which are already driving the growth of _e-_**one-inversion** in the aerospace, automotive, construction, offshore wind and nuclear sectors, A similar method could be used as here.

## Chapter 3 Taking a mission-oriented approach to skills policy

The UK's Grand Challenges programme is positioning the UK to be at the forefront of the green economy through investment in some of the biggest issues facing a new network transition, energy use by buildings, industrial carbon emissions, and transportation. This mission-oriented approach brings together relevant stakeholders to tackle a Grand Challenge - major issue in society that cannot be solved with a single policy intervention or by one actor. The result is a co-ordinated set of policies and partnerships (e.g., regulation, business investment and procurement). A group-ups Grand Challenge can complement this work. Research at Nestas Innovation Growth Lab can support this, as it is working with countries around the world to explore different techniques for defining missions, concerning communities, choosing the right policy and optimising processes. An example in the green jobs skills context could be doubling the share of employment in leader sectors by 2030 or transitioning a quarter of employees in lagged sectors to other jobs by 2030. This set of policy interventions must tackle the cost of training as well as other systemic barriers, like family responsibilities.

## Chapter 2 Supporting inclusive innovation in a green economy

Ensuring a smooth transition to a green economy and sharing the benefits of it across the UK will require an inclusive approach to innovation more generally. While national leadership is required, much of this change will happen in communities, requiring a more targeted approach and community-defined economic responses in the pursuit of a sustainable future. Skills are important drivers of innovation; they are necessary for developing and adopting new technologies. Skills advisory panels help major combined authorities and local Enterprise Partnerships to understand their current and future skills needs and labour market challenges. However, more needs to be done to ensure a green transition is put front and centre of local skills agendas.

Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a dramatic short-term reduction in greenhouse gases, as countries try to contain the spread of disease. Once COVID-19 has passed, society is likely to shift back to some form of normality and emissions are likely to move back to pre-COVID-19 results. However, the current pandemic shows that a collective endeavour involving international, national and local institutions, organizations and individuals to pos positie during global emergencies, and can have major impact on the ability of countries to respond to crises. Similarly, a co-ordinated endeavour will be required to tackle the climate crisis; to achieve the transition to re-net/reply 2050 without creating huge inequalities between individuals, industries and regions, organisations across the UK will have to work together.

Appendix : MethodologyThe report develops the Eco-Transformation of Industries Matrix to assess the level of environmental friendliness of industries across the UK based on two variables: the level of carbon emissions and the level of environmental activities.

The level of carbon emissions is based on the median of emissions intensity for all industries. A detailed, comprehensive computation of carbon emissions intensities1 (CO,/output) was performed to determine an industry rating by level of carbon intensity. With this ranking, the median of CO, emissions across industries was computed and industries were categorized as belonging to the brown sector (above the median) or the green sector (below the median). The assumption is that industries in brown sectors will face the biggest challenges, and jobs in these industries will be in transition.

Footnote 1: [https://www.census.org/](https://www.census.org/)

The level of environmental activities is based on the median of environmental activities intensity for all industries, a detailed, comprehensive computation of environmental activities intensity (output in the EGCS)(output) was performed to determine an industry rating by level of environmental activity. With this ranking, the median of environmental activity across industries was computed and industries were categorized as belonging to the high-intensity environmental activity (above the median) or to the low-intensity environmental activity (below the median). The assumption is that industries with high-intensity environmental activities have already started to become more environmentally friendly, thus generating new jobs.

The four categories of eco-transformation in the UK by industry. 2018

Notes - The two variables (intensity of carbon emissions and intensity of environmental activities) were normalised between 0 and 1 using the min-max normalisation technique. Followers and lagagers are considered to be brown sectors, as they are associated with high carbon emissions, (leaders and transfers are considered to be green sectors, as they are associated with low carbon emissions, (leaders and followers are intensively engaged in activities that directly protect the environment.

Based on the taxonomy, we are able to evaluate the impact of the transition towards a green economy on employment and adult learning, using various data sources (see Table A2).
