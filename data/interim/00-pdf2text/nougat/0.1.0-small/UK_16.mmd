The Institute of Physics is a charity registered in England and Wales (no. 293851) and Scotland (no. SCO40092).

The IOP is the professional body and learned society for physics in the UK and Ireland, with an active role in promoting cooperation in physics around the world. We strive to make physics accessible to people from all backgrounds. Our 22,000 members demonstrate their professional expertise in physics in settings ranging from schools, universities and national research facilities, to businesses of all sizes, and in roles as varied as teacher, researcher, apprentice, technician, engineer and product developer.

The Royal Academy of Engineering is harnessing the power of engineering to build a sustainable society and an inclusive economy that works for everyone. In collaboration with our Fellows and partners, the Academy is growing talent and developing skills for the future, driving innovation and building global partnerships, and influencing policy and engaging the public.
