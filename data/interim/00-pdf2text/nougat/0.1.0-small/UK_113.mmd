Introduction

International research in quantum computers has developed rapidly over the last decade, with many countries investing heavily to support the development of quantum technologies.

This report is the first of two reports that summarise global activity in quantum technology. It presents a snapshot of activities across Europe, focusing on governmental and large-scale groupings and activities.

The report shows the scale of activity, and the growing involvement and maturity of the industrial sector. Research Hubs are a common feature of many of the programmes across Europe, showing the continued relevance of rigorous academic research to the mission of developing Quantum Technologies for real-world applications. There are also emerging procurement based programmes, with National Centres acting as customers for first machines, and of course a growing number of efforts that use the commercially available services available through the cloud. Within all these activities there is a high degree of connectivity between notions, with a large number of jointly authored papers, MOUs between states, and trans-national projects.

I am delighted to see this report bring together on overview of the state of quantum computing research in the UK and Europe. I hope it will be a source of encouragement for those active in quantum computing research, and a reinforcement of the need to commit to this research at a national and a global level.

## United Kingdom

The UK was one of the first countries to initiate a formal national programme in quantum technologies. In 2013, then UK Chronolero George Osbourne mode a "Commentment to invest in quantum technology" in his Autumn Statement [1], which transfected into an initial E270m investment to create a UK National Quantum Technologies Programme (NCTP) [2]. This ultimately grew to 6380m over a five-year period, from 2014-19, and included nearly E13m of private funding.

This 'Phase I' of the UK's national programme included a funding call for dedicated quantum research centres for communications, computing, imaging, sensing, and measurement, leading to four hubs involving close to thirty universities [21]. One of these hubs was Networked Quantum Information Technologies (NDT), involving nine UK universities, and with the support end engagement of over thirty companies. Some of the achievements of the NDT Hub in this time include a photomically-connected tool for architecture with world-leading fidelity, the high-performance emitterOnEST, and the generation of seven spinout companies, such as OOC and Universal Quantum. Separately, there were three skills hubs focussing on training and manpower: Quantum Engineering and Science, Quantum Enterprise, and Innovation in Quantum Business.

The UK programme is sponsored by the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), EPSRC, UKRI, Dostl, GCHO, KTN, STFC and the MoD, and also supports work at the UK National Physical Laboratory and the Frounhofer Centre for Applied Photonics.

The National Quantum Technologies Programme is now in its second phase, which includes a E26m refresh of the four technology Hubs funded by the EPSRC [5]. The technology hub for quantum computing, NOT, evolved into the Quantum Computing and Simulation Hub, mode up of seventeen leading UK universities, and with scientific research spanning the full stock of hardware and software.

The national programme now also includes the National Quantum Computing Centre, launched by the then Science Minister Armando Solinowy at London Tech website in 2020. [6]. Based on the Harwell Science Corpus in Oxfordshire, the NDCC is a E3B3m investment by UKRI over Sierra [7], with the facility due for completion in 2023 [8]. The NDCC's strategic intent includes the creation of a UK, sovereign capability, which will catalyse the UK supply chain in the sector.

Some notable activities for NDCC since its foundation include the signing of a Memorondum of Understanding with the OCS Hub, a collaboration with OOC [10], and the launch of its SPOP Applications Discovery Programme [11]. It has also published a Quantum Readiness Survey in conjunction with ET. This survey found that BIR of senior UK executives expect quantum computing to play a significant role in their industry by 2030 [12].

Outside of this, a new Hartree National Centre for Digital Innovation was announced in June 2021. Quantum computing forms part of a wider programme to enable UK businesses to explore and adopt innovative digital technologies. UKRI will invest EI72 million in the centre over five years, with an additional E38 million in-kind contribution from IBM [13].

Seporately, the reflected Quantum Communications Hub has made major contributions to quantum networking, which is likely to be on enabling technology for OIT. In consortium with BT and Toshibo Europe Ltd. the Quantum Communications Hub has implemented an extended quantum network from Cambridge Science Port to BTS Research and Innovation Labs Campus [ref: [https://www.quantumcomm.techn.net/Industry-government-media/colabortion-opportunities/case-studies/br/](https://www.quantumcomm.techn.net/Industry-government-media/colabortion-opportunities/case-studies/br/)]

Innovate UK have also run and Quantum Commercialisation Challenge, investing EISA million, supported by E205 million from industry, to develop new products and technologies based on advances in quantum science [ref: [https://www.kuriding/what-we-offer/our-moni-funds/industrial-strategy-choliange-fund/orttificial-intelligence-and-dot-aconomy/commercialising-quantum-technologies-challenge/](https://www.kuriding/what-we-offer/our-moni-funds/industrial-strategy-choliange-fund/orttificial-intelligence-and-dot-aconomy/commercialising-quantum-technologies-challenge/)].

## Collaborations

The UK has had significant involvement in projects funded by European Union (EU) mechanisms, primarily through the EP7 and Horizon 2020 funding programmes - these are covered in more depth in the fellowship EU section in this report. The terms of UK involvement in the EU's latest funding programme. Horizon Europe, were agreed in December 2020, however this association has not been finished [24]:The UK government has since launched the Horizon Europe guarantee, with the last legal grant signature date before the end of December 2022. [14] in the event of being unable to associate, the UK has set out its alternative, which includes funds for bottom-up collaborations with researchers in partner countries around the globe, multitarget and bilateral collaborations, and continued funding for UK researchers to join Horizon Europe consorts as third country participants [15].

We have analysed the UK Involvement in EU quantum computing projects - We have analysed the UK Involvement in EU quantum computing projects, covering activity in both FP7 and Horizon 2020. 80 projects were funded in total, one of the highest such figures in Europe, with the projects' start dates distributed as shown.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

The number of citations on a country-by-country basis can provide an insight into levels of activity, as well as crossings and collaborations between the country in question and the originator of the paper. The USA tops the list, followed by the UK, and China, Germany and the Netherlands some distance behind.

European Union

A number of member states of the European Union (EU) are covered in more depth individually later in this report, however there has been a concerted effort by the EU as a whole which will be detailed here.

Quantum Flagship

The Quantum Flagship is the third large-scale research and innovation initiative of its kind, after the Graphene Flagship and the Human Brain Project. It is funded by the European Commission of a set of research and innovation projects selected through a peer-review process. It started in October 2018.[17]

The Flagship has a budget of \(\epsilon\)D billion and a duration of 10 years, and is designed to bring together research institutions, academia, industry, enterprises, and policy makers, in a joint and collaborative initiative.[18]

[FIGURE:S4.F1][ENThe European Commission has a Digital Decode strategy in place, the aim of which is for the EU to become digitally sovereign in an interconnected world. Quantum technologies are seen as a key element of this digital sovereignty, of global strategic importance.

The Flagship will contribute to world-leading quantum computers and simulators that will be (timately) acquired by the European High Performance Computing Joint Understanding - a joint intuitive between the EU, European countries and private partners to develop a world-leading supercomputing ecosystem in Europe. This is carried to the Digital Decode goal of showing a first computer with quantum accretion by 2025, with a view to being at the cutting edge of quantum capabilities by 2030. [18] When examining international partnerships for the Digital Decode, quantum is listed as a potential area of collaboration, though it is worth noting that the European Flagship programme is partly based on an exhibition to reduce or remove the dependency on the USA and China to meet the fundamental technological needs of European citizens and companies. [20]

A newly introduced "Coordination and Support Action" (CSA) collect OUCATS (2020-2025) aims to strengthen the foundations of the Flagship and related initiatives, via maintenance and development of the strategy, and aiming to grow all quantum technologies. This is supported by e6 Sm funding for 3 years by the European Commission.

## Funding Mechanisms

The EU's most noticeable research and innovation funding programme is Horizon Europe, with a budget of e635.5 billion and due to run until 2027. It follows on from Horizon 2020, and the earlier Framework Programmers (FP) for Research and Technological Development. Quantum hosts featured increasingly in these programmes - of the UK's 80 EU quantum-related projects in FP7 and Horizon 2020, 58 were funded through the later Horizon 2020. In Horizon Europe, quantum features within Cluster - A Destination - A Digital and Emerging Technologies for Competiteness and Fit for the Green Debl. There is a clear link to the Quantum Flagship, being listed as its own topic in the destination, with the objective to further develop quantum technologies and other applications in the cores of quantum computing simulation, sensing and communication, in order to strengthen European technological sovereignty in this strategic field and achieve first-mover industry leadership: [21]

A prominent example of a programme receiving funding is OoantERA, which received funding through Horizon 2020. QuantumERA is a European network of 39 research funding organisations from 31 countries, which supports research and innovation in quantum technologies. QuantumERA also funds projects itself, to the level of e63M across 77 projects.

The Programme's goals are as follows:

* [noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
* Successively providing the European quantum community with CoIs for Proposals in OT
* Promoting excellent research in OT
* Encouraging functional collaborations in OT
* Networking research hinders in OT
* Mapping national, regional & European public policies in OT
* Spreading research excellence across the European Research Area (ERA).

QuoantERA aims to enhance cooperation between academia industry, recently issuing guidance for the public sector engaging with industry. Quantum Area cooperates with the European Quantum Technologies Frogship to bridge academic research with engineering endeavours, and joint efforts are directed towards speeding up knowledge and technology transfers. [23]

## Non EU Institutions

There are several Europe-based intergovernment institutions which are not part of the EU that have active Quantum Technology programmes, notably the European Space Agency, (ESA) and CERN (left [https://home.cern.lews/press-release/knowledge-sharing/cern-quantum-technology-infitting-a-much-s-strategic-redromol](https://home.cern.lews/press-release/knowledge-sharing/cern-quantum-technology-infitting-a-much-s-strategic-redromol)).

## France

In January 2021 France announced its Quantum Plan, a G.L.B. billion investment over 5 years. French President Emmanuel Micron outlined two focus areas for the plan: The first is global and integrated technological development, from fundamental research to industrialization. The second is the strengthening of the French innovation ecosystem in its European environment, in particular by developing human capital and by recruiting, training and attracting the best both in public research and industry. [24] A commitment of Ellow the French government sees annual spending of its free from 600 million to 6200 million, described at the time as putting France in third place in this metric after the United States and China. The remaining 6800 million will come from commitments made by industrial players ($500 million). European funding ($200 million), and investors in the French startup ecosystem (E100 million) [24].

The plan allocates nearly 6800 million to computers alone, divided into work on simulators and portrily quantum machines ($350 million) and towards universal fault-tolerant devices ($430 million). The other funds will be devoted to sensors ($250 million), post-quantum cryptography (E150 million), quantum communications ($320 million) and related technologies with facilitate the development of quantum equipment (properties, for example, E200 million) [25] [26]. As part of this plan, in January 2002 the creation of a new quantum computing platform was announced. The platform has a total budget of E10 million, and aims to make the technology accessible to as many people as possible, including the scientific community and French and EU start-ups. The intent is to ensure France does not miss out on the major advances quantum computing could make in the decades to come. [22] Secretary of State for Digital, Cedric O, remarked: "By mid-2022, we will open a procedure [1] for the purchase of two to three quantum hardware machines that are integrated in the platform."

In March 2022, ten selected projects were announced during the launch of the E150M Quantum Priority Research and Equipment Programme (PEPR) over 5 years. The Quantum PEPR is on acceleration programme, aiming at supporting research activity ranging from basic science to proofs of concept (TRL to 4), and is co-driven by the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), and the French National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology (INRIA) [27].

A selection of these refatting to quantum computing are shown below:

The **PRESQULE** project is to help identify and overcome the scientific and technological obstacles to integrating spin qubits within well-established CMOS technology.

The **RobustSuperQ** project aims to accelerate French RBD reflecting to superconducting and hybrid qubits protected against decoherence. In 5 years, the project should demonstrate a high-fidelity quantum processor that is controllable and measurable.

The **QubitAE** project is to improve cold-atom platforms for quantum simulation by increasing the number of manipulated atoms.

certifying results, and detailing the performance of these platforms.

* The **DAFCA** project seeks to develop compact and transportable cold-atom sensors to measure gravitational fields, with applications in climate change analysis and the anticipation of natural disasters, and even in civil engineering and CO2 storage.
* **DIAMANT**, which is closely connected to industry, deals with NV centres in diamonds, aiming to create the entire chain necessary for the manufacturer of these defects and their exploitation.
* The **NISO2LSQ** project will study in-depth the different correction strategies for random errors through the quantum aspect of qubits. Correction codes will be tested in experiments on superconducting and photonic platforms.
* The **EpiQ** project will study all the logical building blocks needed for a quantum processor for function property (complication, manipulation, optimization, intermediary languages, certification, etc.) by identifying constraints and better simulating actual machines, in an effort to develop new algorithms that can surpass today's capacities
## Quantum Centres

There are several notable hubs for quantum in France:

### Paris Centre for Quantum Computing (PCOC)

The PCDC was established in 2014, with the long-term objectives of high impact, interdisciplinary research; international visibility for the quantum research in Paris and in France; the dissemination of quantum research via workshops/visits and students exchange; and the collection with industry for the commercialization of end-to-end quantum solutions.

PCDC is to research federation mode up of the CNRS, the University of Paris, Sorbonne University, and letter enlarged to include INRIA and PSI, Research University, Its research areas, including quantum computing and the foundations of quantum information, are shown [28].

Quantum Engineering Grenoble orms to develop a highly connected ecosystem for quantum technologies, through fostering interfaces between different areas of knowledge and creating synergies between academia and industry. Six work packages are contained within QEuEng, including several directly or indirectly related to quantum computing as shown. A fundamental contribution of our project is to train the next generations of quantum engineers, and hence QEuEng hosts two PhD programmes. The QEuEng doctoral programme funded by the Idea-UGA, and the GreQue doctoral programme funded by the Marie-Sidodowska Curie Actions within Horizon 2020 [30].

### Work packages include:

* Quantum processes and simulators
* Architecture and software
* photon interfaces
* Quantum sensing
* Energetics of quantum computing
* Philosophical and societal challenges of quantum technologies

In addition, QEuEng has a Quantum Algorithmic Group, which investigates topics including architectures of quantum computers, quantum error correction, quantum programming language and compilation, computation models based on quantum phenomena, and applications. The labs involved within this group are shown in Table 1.

## Collaborations

In 2018, the then Prime Minister of Australia, Melchiorn Turnbull, and the President of France, Emmanuel Morron, announced plans for a new French-Australian collaboration between Austratroids first quantum computing company, Silicon Quantum Computing (SOC), and the French research and development organisation, the Commission of a Energy Atomicer at our Energies Alternatives (the CEA). The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) outlines steps to form a joint venture in Silicon CMOS quantum computing technology to accelerate technology development and create commercial opportunities [31]. In August 2020, a joint statement between France and the Netherlands was signed, strengthening bilateral cooperation in quantum technologies. [32] The then Dutch secretary of state for economic affairs and climate policy, Monoz Kejer, developed a European quantum ecosystem, and noted that The Netherlands and France have been leaders in this field for years, and in order to maintain this international lead, it is necessary to cooperate at the European level.

At an institutional level, France's research lab CNRS has expanded its presence in Canada with the creation of the Quantum Frontiers Lab with Universite de Sherbrooke. THE collaboration was initially part of the Quantum Circuits and Materials Laboratory' (LUMG) Informed Research Project (BRV), which was created in 2017 between the Physics Department of University at the Sherbrooke and multiple laboratories in France. Based on the success of this collaboration, the IBP has now become an International Research Laboratory (IRU) with quantum circuits and devices one of its major research focuses. Its goal is to conduct cutting-edge collaborative heterodimer research, to promote exchange between researchers and students from Universite de Sherbrooke and France, and to promote emerging projects between the scientific communities of France and Quebec [33].

The multinational Tables, which is headquartered in Paris and in which the French State has over a 25S stroke [34], is notably active in quantum technologies. In September 2021, Theses signed on MoU with the National University of Singapore (NUS), moving the start of a two-year competitive to jointly develop and test quantum technologies for commercial applications [35], in December of the same year. Theies, PASCAL, the Paris Regional Authority and GENCI announced a multi-year partnership to develop new methods to address planning and scheduling challenges related to the optimization of critical systems through PASCAL's quantum processor. The project is supported by the PASCAL Quantique program (PAQ), on initiative launched in 2020 by the Paris Regional Authority, GENCI and Le Lib Quantique to accelerate the development of quantum technologies [38].

## Germany

The Federal Republic of Germany is based on the principle of federalism and on constructive cooperation between the Federal Government and the IB individual states (called the United). The Federal Government and the states act independently regarding the funding and organisation of research. In 2018 gross Germany more than 104 billion euros were invested in research and development generally, with the public sector providing approximately 30% of funding - in addition to funding higher education, the public sector offers non-university research organisations that are especially involved in fostering research talent. There are more than 5,000 foundations incorporated under civil law in Germany that aim to promote science. The Switzerland is an association of foundations, which in 2018 done provided IT2 million euros in funding for education, science and cooperation between business and science. Additionally, roughly 615.5 million euros used to fund endowed chris. [37] in 2019, business enterprises investigated more than 675.6 billion in 1860. making industry the biggest contributor to R&D funding. The Federation of Germany Industries (BDD) is the umbrella organisation for more than 40 affiliated industrial associations that represent the interests of over 100,000 companies with more than 8 million employees.

In May 2021, Germany announced a 62bn national programme, divided into two streams. The science ministry committed to spend GL1bn by 2025 to support research and development in quantum computing. The economy ministry will spend 6487bn bocking period applications, of which Germany's Aerospace Center (DLW) will receive the bulk of the funding - about 6740m to partner with industrial companies. Then Science Minister Arab Artifrezkot sof the government's goal was to meet the target of building a competitive quantum computer in Germany in five years, and to create a network of companies in the field to develop cutting-edge applications [38].

## Quantum Centres

### Quantum Alliance

The Quantum Alliance is a consortium of "German Clusters of Excellence" and research centres working in quantum science and technology across Germany, which was formed in 2018. The Quantum Alliance is funded by the German Research Foundation [39].

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & Munich Quantum Valley \\ \end{tabular}

At a state level, notable is the Munich Quantum Valley (MOV), an initiative for the promotion of Quantum science and technology supported by the Bavarian state government. As a whole between research, industry, funders and the public it is intended, among other things, to help develop and operate competitive quantum computers in Bavaria, in addition to education and training. It is part of Bavaria's Highesta Agenda- or fund of E900m to strengthen the state's technology investment in 2021 and 2022.

### A Appendix

The _Julich Supercomputing Centre_, based in the state of North Rhine-Weststrable, was the first German supercomputing centre, opening in 1987. It opened a new quantum computer building in summer 2021, and now offers JUNO (Julich Unified Infrastructure for Quantum computing) - a "Quantum Computing Platform as a Service," providing European users support and access to quantum computer resources and quantum computing technologies of different types and maturity. JUNO will also integrate quantum computers in the form of quantum-classical hybrid computing systems into the modular HPC environment of the Julich Supercomputing Centre.[47]

An important part of this is OSIGid, of four-year project running from January 2020 to December 2026, which aims to develop a comprehensive ecosystem for a demonstrator based on superconducting qubits, which will be made accessible to external users via JUNO. 25 companies and research institutions are involved in the project, which has a budget of $76.3m, the majority of which is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. The first prototypes of the planned demonstrators in OSIGid are being produced at Leibniz IHP II. Jeno and are expected to be operational by 2024.[49]

### Research institutions involved in OSIGid include:

* Leibniz IHPIT Peter Grubberg Institute
- National Metrology Institute (PTB).
* CS Forschungsinstitut fur Central Institute of Engineering.
* Microsensors.
* Ulm University.
* University of Stuttgart, Forschungszentrum Julicht) Freie Universitat Berlin,
* Fraunhofer IMPS University of Konstanz,
* Fraunhofer IZM-ASSD, University of Cologne
* Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (RTD).

### Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft

The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, based in Germany, is a leading applied research organization which plays a significant role in the innovation process. Founded in 1949, it operates 76 institutes and research units throughout Germany and has over 30,000 employees, with an annual research budget of $2.9 billion, of which $2.5 billion is from contract research (501). In June 2021 it attenuated a collaboration with IHP, through the hosting of the first IBM quantum computer outside the United States, within the "Competence Center Quantum Computing Boden-Wurttemberg." The system is evolvable to industrial companies, SPIE, students and accelerate institutions, with all processed project and user data extending in Germany. Our goal is to enable Software, supremberg, as to leading industrial and innovative region in Europe, to play a major role in creating added value with quantum computing" said Dr. Nicole Hoffmeister-Krout, the state's Minister of Economic Affairs, Labour and Housing [SI], [SI].

Six collaborative projects have been announced by the Competence Centre for kickoff in 2021 and 2022. Six Fraunhofer Institutes are collaborating on these projects, along with 16 other university, college and non-university institutes from the state so well as about 40 associated corporate partners from Boden-Wurttemberg and wider Germany [SI], [SI]. A call for proposals to a second phase of projects was announced in June 2022, aiming to transfer research into practical applications and further expand the quantum computing ecosystem of universities, research institutes, start-ups and companies in Boden-Wurttemberg [SI].

## Collaborations

In July 2018 Germany's Forschungszentrum Julich and the DESY (Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron) research centre signed on MoJ with the Consorion companies TRIUMF. TRIUMF Innovations, D-Wave Systems and IQRI. The MoJ sets out to jointly establish Consorion and German quantum computing and machine learning networks and to collaborate on applied quantum computing and machine learning initiatives and mutual interest [54]. This represents a strong, international collaboration between the research and private sectors.

In 2021, a report completed for Conocuts National Research Council (NIC) by Global Advantage identified Germany as a priority collaboration partner in research and development of quantum technologies [55].

An analysis of German involvement in EU projects reveals more activity than any other country, or 87 projects total, 48 of which began between 2017 and 2021.

We analysed papers published from 2018 onwards, with some or all of the authors are based in German institutions. A visualisation of the top ten funding bodies for these bodies of work is shown below - as well as domestic and European funding, there is also notable activity from China, the UK and Spain. Similar visualisations categorising the papers and showing the affiliations of the authors are also shown.

## Austria

The Quantum Austria Research Initiative launched November 2021 and runs until 2026. At the initiative of the Austrian Federation Ministry of Education, Science and Research (BMBWF), 6107m funding was invested from the NextGenerationEU Development and Resilience Plan to accelerate the development of quantum research methodologies. The aim is to enhance Austria's competitiveness and increase European cooperation in this strategic key technology sector, with funding available for both basic research as well as the development of practical applications. A total of three calls for applications are planned until 2020 IEEE [58], [57].

The first Quantum Austria projects were announced in July 2022. The first project to be approved was the proposal "HSUSCA" (Multi-Site Computer Austititi) with funding amount of 620 million. This pilot project under the consortium usedership of the Vienna Scientific Cluster, a collaboration of several Austrian universities, aims to establish a powerful new research infrastructure in the field of high-performance computing in Austria in the coming years. Coupling this HPC infrastructure with a quantum computer is one of the funding initiatives key goals. [58] G3 million of funding was also made available for ten university-led research projects in Graz, Innsbruck, and Vienna.

## Quantum Centres

The Vienna Centre for Quantum Science and Technology (VCC) is a joint initiative of the University of Vienna, the Vienna University of Technology, the Austrian Academy of Sciences, and the Institute of Science and Technology Austria, which unites quantum physics of Vienna's research institutions in one collaborative centre. The research institutions are the University of Vienna, the Vienna University of Technology, the Institute of Science and Technology Austria, and the Austrian Academy of Sciences. There are 14 research groups in the Quantum Information / Computing / Communication work package, and it is notable how the VCC so closely groups the work between computing and communication [59], [60].

Vienne is also home to the Vienna Doctoral Program on Complex Quantum Systems (CoCoSi) to training center for around 40 students who are selected from an international pool of scientists, based primarily on theirocratic excellence. The doctoral program is funded by the Austrian Science Fund, and jointly hosted and co-financed by the University of Vienna and the Vienna University of Technology. Research in CoCoSi covers experimental and theoretical quantum physics, including quantum information science and computation, cold atoms and atom chips, and quantum integrated devices.

## Research groups include:

* [1] Quantum information science and quantum computation
* [2] Matrix-wave interferometry
* [3] Many-body quantum theory
* [4] Theory of quantum foundations
* [5] Quantum micromechanics
* [6] Relativistic quantum information
* [7] Quantum information and foundations of physics and several other areas [81].

In a similar vein, the Austrian Academy of Sciences runs the Erwin Schrodinger Center for Quantum Science of Technology (ESO) ESO is described on Austria-wide postdoc programme, supporting the integration of incoming experienced researchers, and discovery programme allowing the exploration of highly innovative research. It is financed by the BMBWF; with the project also receiving funding from the EU's Horizon 2020 programme, and is operated in partnership with 40 Austrian research groups at the University of Vienna, the Vienna University of Technology and the University of Innsbruck, as well as the Austrian Academy of Sciences [82].

The University of Innsbruck is a major centre for the development of trapped ion technologies, and was the first research group to successfully demonstrate controlled teleportation of quantum information fedeterministic quantum teleportation with electrons, Nature 429 734 (2004). They have research programmes:

* [2] 2D ion crystals for quantum simulation
* [3] Ocosmo (Quantum Control of Molecules)
* [4] Single ion-single photon interactions
* [5] Quantum information
* [6] Quantum Simulation
* [7] Photon frequency conversion for ions
* [8] Ultrafast two-qubit phase gates
* [9] Precision measurements

## Collaborations

Austtion research is also highly collaborative, with the BMBWF stating "intermontional collaboration and international exchange in education, science and research are essential prerequisites for ensuring satisfying squality location for calculations in these fields." [63]. The EU is particularly important in this context. Since 2014 Austria has received around ELS billion from Horizon 2020 across all fields, with 3.856 contributions of which approximately 37% can be attributed to businesses and 29% to universities, enabling third in Europe. [64]. In the context of Quantum Austria, the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) described how the funding instruments of FFG and FWF (Austtion Science Fund) provide tailor-mode support here for fieldist technologies along the entire innovation axis. In addition, through its European network, FFG is contributing to strengthening transactional cooperation on this important key technology." [56].

An example of Austrios's collaboration with European neighbours is a project around sign qubits, as published in Nature Materials under A singlet-triplet hole spin qubit in planar Ge. The authors are affiliated with institutions in Austria, Italy, Germany and Spain, with the research supported by funding from multiple sources, [65][66].

An analysis of papers published from 2018 onwards, with some of all of the authors are based in Austrian institutions, was undertaken. A visualisation of the top ten funding bodies for these bodies of work is shown below - as well as domestic and European funding there is also notable activity from Germany and the United States. Similar visualisations showing the affiliations of the authors are also shown.

## Denmark

Denmark has a proud history in quantum, from Niels Bohr formulating his theory on the hydrogen atom in 1913. Its quantum research activity is strong. The University of Copenhagen works 7th in the world on quantum scientific impact measured by the number of unique first-author publications, and Danish quantum researchers receive a higher proportion of EU research funds than researchers in other fields. Demerk has the highest concentration of enriched graduates attending quantum-related scientific studies globally, with 835 graduates attending quantum-related studies per million inhabitants. France has the second most graduates with 438 per million inhabitants [67, 20].

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark highlights the competencies shown within the Danish quantum ecosystem. Despite this, Denmark does not have a formal notion/programme in place. Certain stakeholders consider the government's official stance on quantum technology and support for funding applied research and innovation to be weaker than in neighbouring countries, though the stakeholders do recognise that some government actors show addiction to the quantum agenda, notably Innovation Fund Denmark and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, [20].

A noteworthy project recently funded by the Innovation Fund is PhotoO, a four-year, circc 63m initiative. The project thus the overarching ambitation to build a scalable photonic-based quantum computer. The consortium behind this works across the entire value chain, with expertise in logistics optimization provided by an MCS Group, quantum chemistry via Molecular Quantum Solutions, quantum algorithmic expertise at Aarhus University and Kountly, loser technology from NKT Photonics, and in the development of photonic quantum computer hardware at the Technical University of Denmark, [68].

[title=In June 2022 the University of Copenhagen, in collaboration with DTU, announced Denmark's first programme of study in quantum information science, aimed at ensuring the development of a qualified quantum sciences workforce. The programme is a two-year MSc that is interdisciplinary, combining the fields of physics, implementations, chemistry and computer science, and begins with a general introduction to quantum information theory before specifications [71].

A notable trait in Denmark is the significant role of foundations in the funding of quantum research and development. This can be shown with the activity of two foundations. The Vilum Foundation and The Novo Hordisk Foundation. The Vilum Foundation, founded in 1971, primarily supports research activities in science and technology, and makes large grants to "research centres without walls" the VKR Centrese of Excellence. [72] in 2016 is granted 20th DOX (-44m) for new research center at the University of Copenhagen - The Vilum Centre of Excellence for the Mathematics of Quantum - with the aim to contribute to the mathematical understanding of quantum physics, with a special emphasis on the interaction between quantum matter and quantum information.

The Novo Hordisk Foundation is an independent Danish foundation with corporate interests, which awarded nearly 5th DOX in grants for new projects and initiatives in 2021 (2020). [73] in September 2020, it awarded 108.6m DOX (-41.6m) to the University of Copenhagen for two new centres, focussed on quantum simulation in the field of biochemistry. The Solid-State Quantum Simulators for Biochemistry (Solid-Q) centre will work on applying and integrating two types of quantum simulation hardware, whilst the Quantum for Life centre aims to develop mathematical algorithms that do not be used for the quantum simulation of biomolecules. [74] More recently, in July 2020 the foundation provided 13.7m DOX for the research project Fundamentals of Neutral Atom Quantum Simulators, as part of its NED programme. [75] in September 2022, the Novo Hordisk Foundation announced a twelve year programme to develop Democracks first fully functional generally applicable quantum computer, with funding of DOX 15 billion [76].

## Collaborations

Denmork is a small notion and traditionally relies on collaboration and partnerships to overcome key barriers [20]. In April 2022, it was announced that NATO had selected a Danish site to host a quantum technology centre, so part of the Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA). The centre will be based on the Nest Bohr Institute with contributions from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), the Aarhus University, and the Danish National Metrology Institute. The project will consist of on accelerator to provide funding and mentoring for companies to develop commercial solutions, and to centre for development and testing of physical components for quantum technologies.

A test centre and manufacturing unit composed of physical laboratories and testing facilities that could be involved in the development and testing of physical components for quantum sensors, quantum encryption units, or quantum computing[76].

On June 6th 2022, Denmark and the United States signed a Joint Statement on Cooperation in Quantum Information Science and Technology, described as a means of leveraging both countries' strengths in quantum information science and technology (OST) and GIST-embiding fields to pursue innovative research, grow the future.

marketplace, build a strong supply chain, and nurture future skills. Anne Hougaard Jensen, Director of Invest in Denmark, noted that with the Joint Statement '1'm sure that our increased cooperation with American companies and research institutions will grow our world-class ecosystem further. [77].

An analysis of Denmark's involvement in EU projects reveals 3S projects funded in total, with over half that number starting since 2017.

Outside of this, VTT and KIM are co-developing Finland's first quantum computer (superconducting) as part of e20.7m public procurement project funded by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment. This begins with an initial five-qubit computer, Berlin, with an overall goal to build a larger, 50-qubit device by around 2024. [79]. Helm, hosted at VTT, will be connected with the Finnish LUHI exo-scale supercomputer. LUHI is co-funded by the European High-Performance Computing Joint Unterotating (through the EU's Connecting.

Europe Facility and Horizon 2020) and the LUHI Consortium, composed of the following countries: Finland, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Iceland, Norway, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland [85] [87].

## Collaborations

In April 2022 a Joint Statement of the United States and Finland around cooperation in OST was issued. This described collaboration and joint promotion in quantum computing and networking, as well as other quantum technologies, as underpinning the development of society and industry. It also included a statement "committing to create inclusive scientific research communities and tackle cross-cutting issues of common interest such as equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility, so that every person is able to fully participate and have an equal opportunity to succeed [88]. In the same month, it was announced that India and Finland will establish on Indonesia. Finnish Virtual Network Centre on Quantum Computing. The bilateral collaboration between the two countries attempts to stimulate innovative research and development projects that address a specific need or challenge, demonstrate high industrial relevance and commercial potential, and deliver benefit to both notions [89].

An analysis of Finland's involvement in EU projects reveals 19 projects funded in total, with over half starting in the last four years.

Netherlands

September 2019 saw the release of National Agenda for Quantum Technology (NAOT), with the intent of positioning the Netherlands as a world-length centre and how for quantum technology. The Netherlands has invested approximately 652 million in quantum technology research and development, with funding from the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy. In 2020, ES4M was allocated from the National Growth Fund for the programmes' first phase, with a further 622nm conditionally allocated for a second phase. In 2020, this conditional grant was converted into a definitive grant, and of further 6333m reserved from the National Growth Fund for 3rd phase. There is emphasis on creating a strong ecosystem connecting research, industry, startups, and national facilities [90][91]. Core areas for the programme include Quantum Computation, Quantum Communication, Quantum Simulation and Quantum Sensing. For each one, the programme is building an network of suppliers, equipment manufacturers, application developers and end users [92].

Quantum Delta Netherlands (ODNL) is a public-private partnership of global technology companies, government agencies and all major quantum research centers in the Netherlands, launched in 2020 with the mandate to coordinate and execute the Netherlands's national agenda for NATO. ODNL is described as a comprehensive program to "turn the NL into Silicon Valley for Quantum Technologies," aiming to position the Netherlands as a leading ecosystem in quantum technologies, with actions targeting all aspects of the ecosystem [93].

There are five hubs within ODNL, as shown, headquered at Delft, Amsterdam, Leiden, Eindhoven, and Twente. Each hub consists of research institutes, universities, companies, and startups. ODNL's funding will be used to train 2,000 researchers and engineers, to scale 100 stertups and to host three corporate RBD labs in the Netherlands by 2027.

Quantum Computing and Simulation is one of the QDNL's three key technology demonstrators, with research and innovation and quantum ecosystem forming the first two action lines [94][93]. Furthermore, as part of the ODNL network, researchers at Eindhoven University of Technology are building a hybrid quantum computer, with on-tin to deliver by 2024 [95].

in August 2021, on HoU was signed between the Netherlands and France, with responsibility for implementation lying with ODNL and the French national quantum programme. The MoU is designed to strengthen cooperation in areas of mutual interest, including scalable quantum computers, cross-border quantum communication networks, private investment in start-ups and industry involvement in quantum. The first action from the MoU was a joint Dutch/French job board, an initiative of OPLN, which offers a free overview the majority of jobs available in the quantum-ecosystem of the Netherlands and France, which are collected daily from the sites of storumps, knowledge institutes and businesses [36].

In March 2022, the Quantum Application Lab (BAL) opened to explore the advantages and business opportunities for quantum computing

* GAL is a public-private RBD partnership that offers a unique team of scientists, researchers, engineers, application developers, software and hardware specialists in a leading platform to explore and bring to market the benefits of quantum computing. GAL will support companies to navigate this complex and demographic environment. It will focus mainly on optimization, simulation and machine learning applications. The founding consortium partners of GAL are: the University of Amsterdam (NuA) and Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (KWI, the national research institute for mathematics and computer science).
* The Netherlands Organization for applied scientific research (TNO)

IBM Quantum will serve as a technology provider [37].

## Quantum Centres

In June 2015, TU Delft and TNO, along with the Dutch Research Council, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Education announced their intention to support Oufetton for a period of 10 years, with the knowledge and Innovation programme Holland HighTech also partnering on the endeavour. Holland High Tech is one of the nine key economic focus areas established and supported by the Dutch government to further strengthen the Dutch international position through the "golden triangle" formed by companies, research institutes and government. [98] OutTech is a mission-driven research institute for quantum computing, covering the full stock from and with particular strengths in solid-state qubits, as well as the quantum internet [87][188]. Since 2015 OutTech has collaborated with Intel on spin qubits in quantum dots, superconducting qubits, cryogenic control electronics, and quantum computer architecture. [99] OutTech's goals for quantum computing are:

* To build a modular spin-qubit processor
* To release a scalable error-protected logical qubit with a 1/2-qubit superconducting circuit
* To develop a scalable quantum computing control system stock
* To implement cryogenic integrated control and readout electronics operating in close proximity to the qubits
* To provide analyses and ideas towards implementing and assessing the performance of quantum error correction for superconducting spin qubits [99][100].

OutTech also has the Qubit Research (QuRe) division, working to develop novel qubits that are protected from noise by design, on the belief that protected qubits will enable them to build a scalable quantum computer.

In 2019 QItech announced a partnership with Microsoft, who opened a new tab at Delft called the Microsoft Quantum Lab Delft in 2018. Ernst-Jan Stigter, General Manager of Microsoft Netherlands, asserted that 'Quint public-private investments in resources and infrastructure, os we see here today, are critical to a quantum future.' [100].

In May 2020, QuTech announced Quantum Inspire, a prototype full-stock quantum computer, serving os a driving enduelotron platform, to test-bed for application development and os an introduction for co-development and collaborative RB of quantum computers. Quantum Inspire is described os a platform with a high degree of modularity, containing a processor mode of semiconductor spin qubits whilst also providing access to a processor mode of superconducting (transmon) qubits. [102] Oiltech is also founder of Quantum Delft, a research and business community working within the growing quantum ecosystem of Delft [103].

As well as QuTech, QuSoft - collaboration between the University of Amsterdam (JNA) and Centrum Wishunde & Informatica (CWI) - was also founded in 2015.

QuSoft's mission is to develop new protocols, algorithms and applications that can be run on small to full-cost prototypes of a quantum computer [204]. The research at QuSoft can be divided into five research lines: Quantum Simulations & Few-Qubit Applications, Quantum Information Science, Cryptography in Quantum World, Quantum Algorithms & Complexity and Quantum for Society and Business.

One notable project QuSoft is working on is Project DisQower, a collaboration with ABN MDR that enlarges potential applications of quantum computing in the financial industry. It is to identify the complex computing problems ABN AMRO is currently tackling or avoid like to tackle in the near future, and research if and how these problems can be solved more efficiently on a quantum computer. QuSoft is also working with the Bosch Group in two-year collaboration, investigating potential quantum computing use cases at Bosch, in topics ranging from optimization to machine learning. The collaboration involves an exploratory study of the use cases, as well as in-depth analysis and proof-of-concept simulations of the most promising applications [105].

QuSoft has also started on exchange program with Quantum Loop Africa (GLA), a research institute in Rwanda closely linked to AIMS, the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences. For this exchange program QuSoft hosts QLA Master students - during their time in the Netherlands, they work on MS research project under the guidance of QuSoft researchers to prepare them for future in quantum research [106].

At a regional level, QuSoft founded Quantum.Amsterdam, along with partners Centrum Wishunde is information and the University of Amsterdam. It is an innovation hub with mission to connect academia, industry and society in a quantum ecosystem in the Amsterdam region by facilitating knowledge exchanges and innovation [107].

Both QuTech and QuSoft are collaborating as part of the Quantum Software Consortium (QSC) GSC is a project of University of Amsterdam, Ledelen University, Delft University of Technology. Center for Mathematics and Computer Science (CWI) and vrije Universitextraction, portrived with QuTech and QuSoft, which is funded through the Revolution programme of NW0 (Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research) and awarded to 10-year grant for fundamental research in 2017. The QSC leverages the nearby clusters of expertise in quantum software (QuSoft, QuTech & Ledelen) and quantum hardware (QuTech). Amsterdam & Ledelen, and acts across four research lines, (i) software for quantum computers, (ii) software for quantum networks, (iii) cryptography in a quantum work and (iv) demonstrators [108][109].

Women in Quantum Development, or in short WOD (pronounced 'wicked') is a professional network for quantum technology enthusiasts from industry, academia, and policy its mission is to bring together women in quantum in the Netherlands, and beyond, for support, networking, and community growth [110].

An analysis of the Netherlands's involvement in EU projects reveals \(4\bar{2}\) projects funded in total, and a clear ramp-up in activity - half of the projects have started within the last three years alone.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:31]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:32]

in terms of European activity, fifteen research teams from Poland were among the winners of the QuantERA Co-funded Call 2021 for international research projects in the field of quantum technologies. Ten basic research projects will be co-funded by the National Science Centre and the applied research projects will be co-funded by the National Centre for Research and Development. The National Science Centre also awarded funding for that purpose of our PLN 77(117), Poland has host seven quantum-computing-related projects funded through FP7 and Horizon 2020.

We analysed papers published from 2018 onwards, where some or all of the authors are based in Polish institutions. A visualisation of the top ten funding bodies for these bodies of work is shown below, along with visualisations showing the affiliations of the authors are also shown. Germany, the UK and Spain all feature prominently.

These papers were then ranked in terms of number of citations, and the top fifty selected. These fifty papers were cited 440 times between them. These citations can provide an indication of activity, as well crossburts and colloorptions between the countries in question. Other than the USA (which tops the list) and Poland itself, Germany, China, the UK, Spain and the Netherlands feature highly.

Spain

Spain's national initiative, Quantum Spain, is formed within the National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence. Its aim is to establish a solid quantum computing ecosystem in Spain, taking advantage of and promoting the latent of local reserves who are experts in this technology. This objective leverages the existing Spanish Supercomputing Network [118]. E22m was initially made available for the endeavour, with funding provided by Sports Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation and the EU's NextGenerationEU.

Quantum Spain involves 25 universities and infrastructure and supercomputing centres, from 14 autonomous communities. The Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC, the main node of the Spanish Supercomputing Network) began coordination work on the project in 2021. [118]

The project foresees the construction of a quantum computer that will be installed at BSC headquarters and that will progressively be equipped with chips of different generations of numbers of qubits, initially based on superconducting circuit technology. The construction of the hardware will be carried out in collaboration with companies [119]. In June 2022, on open cell for tender for a quantum computer was announced. This is on E22m call for the "coquisition of a computer based on superconducting qubit technology and its quantum processors," for use by the BSC-CNS and the users of the Spanish Supercomputing Network."

BSC also has a Quantite Group, focussed on quantum simulation architectures in HPC systems, allowing the behaviour of quantum algorithms to be reproduced using the parallelised architecture of supercomputers. These simulators will make it easier for developers to design circuits and algorithms, reproducing the operation of ideal quantum computers (without noise), offering traceability of the steps to be executed, as well as a reference for experimental developments [120].

There are various other groups within Quantum Spain, such as The QUANTA (Quantum AI for scientific and industrial applications) group of Universidad de Zoragoia is exploring applications of quantum optimization for commercial and scientific interests. These include comparative studies of quantum algorithms of optimization (orientation algorithms NIQ, quantum anneiders, and qatt type molecular processors), and analysis of non-superpixel quantum machine learning algorithms [121]. Another team is the Quantum Computers and Quantum Simulations Group of the University of Valencia, which studies and chorectaries noise in quantum computers using AI techniques. [123]

Quantum Spain also has a "Tolerant0 programme, designed to train the next generation of quantum experts. The Tolerant0 program will promote the search and training of Spanish quantum talent through the organisation of online and force-to-force courses, quantum hostrooms, promotion of local initiatives and groups in quantum computing, among other activities [124].

Outside of Quantum Spain, in January 2022, the CUCO (Clomtonic COmputacion) project to research potential quantum computing applications, led by form MW was announced, running for 2 years with 6.82 GHz funding. The project focuses on quantum computing applications and algorithms in the strategic industries of the Spanish economy such as Energy, Financial, Space, Defence and Logistics. It includes 7 companies (Amtech, BSWA, DAS Photonics, GMV, Multiverse Computing, Chiminaro QuantumTech and Reposl, S research centres (BSC, CLC, DTC, CFG) of Tecnolid) and the public university (IPV Universiteit Politecnico de Valencia) [125]. It is financed by the Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology, with support from the Ministry of Science and Innovation [126].

An analysis of the Spinn's involvement in EU projects reveals 43 projects funded in total, with a large portion of activity taking place between 2018-2020.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:35]

Sweden

Sweden looks a national programme in quantum, however that is not to say the country looks large-scale, coordinated activity. A prime example of this is the Volenberg Centre for Quantum Technology (WACOT) established in 2018 to create long-term expertise in quantum computing, simulation, communication, and sensing This SEK 12bn (circo E100mv) centre gears multiple universities and is funded through the Knut and Alice Wollenberg Foundation, with an additional SEK 200mn (mren universities and industry taking total funding to SEK 14bn. The research programme is managed and mainly located at Chalmers University of Technology, with KTH Royal Institute of Technology and Lund University, as well as several industrial partners, including Seoul, Hitachi ABR, AstraZeneca, Ericsson, Copenhagen and Video (2017). The collaboration between academic and industry is seen as key for taking Sweden forward. In this case provide WACOT scientists with real-life applications to investigate whilst companies gain forefront knowledge and competence which allow them to identify business opportunities [127], [128].

Quantum Computing is considered core for WACOT [128]. There is a strong expertise in superconducting qubits, on which the project's principled investigators have worked for many years. The strong cooperation between experimentists and theoreticians is considered a cornerstone for success of WACOT. The first milestone for the quantum computer project is to build two iteratively blocks each contributing ten qubits with four years, which will make it possible to demonstrate basic quantum simulations of small systems. The find goal is to develop a 100-qubit quantum computer within ten years.

WACOT has a vision to its to build on open and interactive Swedish quantum technology community, considering that rich flow of ideas in on open environment increases both the scientific quality and relevance as well as shortens the time to utilisation of results. The following instruments help achieve this: a graduate school, the Swedish Graduate School in Quantum Technology, a postdoc program: a guest researcher program: Industrial partnerships [127], [128].

## Collaborations

In April 2022, the United States and Sweden signed a Quantum Cooperation Statement, deciding the shared operations of both countries to engage in good-foth cooperation in OTS, such as to build a global market and supply chain, and to create respectful and inclusive scientific research communities. Anne Kistrom, the Swedish Minister for Education, Ministry of Education and Research, said: "By making a joint statement that we want to collaborate in the quantum field, Swedish and American researchers get the opportunity to collaborate with the best researchers in this field in our two countries. It contributes to strengthening our position as leading research nations," [129].

Sweden is involved in several large-scale EU-funded projects, collaborating with European partners. A notable example is the aforementioned Choms University of Technology. Andrew qubits for scalable quantum computation (AndO). The goal of this project is to establish the foundations of a new solid state platform for scalable quantum computation, based on Andrew qubits. This platform is implemented by utilizing the discrete superconducting quasiparticle levels (Andrere review) that appear in weak links between superconductors. The 63.6m project runs from September 2019 to March 2023 and consists of the below partners organisations:

* Delft University of Technology (Academic, Netherlands)
* National Research Council of Italy (CNR) (Public, Italy)
* Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UJA) (Academic, Spain)
* The French Attentive Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) (Research Institute, France)
* University of Basel (Academic, Switzerland)
* University of Copenhagen (Academic, Denmark)
* Budapest University of Technology and Economics (Academic, Hungary) [130]

Aside from the strengths in superconducting in Sweden, there is a notable expertise in dropped Rydberg ions in Stockholm, in 2017, researchers at Stockholm University reported on the excitation of a single trapped strontium ion in the Rydberg state, and that some year carried out the first coherent Rydberg excitation of an ion and performed a single-qubit Rydberg gate, thus demonstrating the basic elements of a proposed Rydberg ion quantum computer [131], [132], A new 3.6m project in this field begins in October 2022. Brisk Rydberg ions for Scinole Quantum Processes (BPSQ), led from Stockholm University, aims to realize a prototype of a fully scalable quantum computer which has the capability to run quantum algorithms with a circuit depth exceeding time.

## Switzerland

Switzerland was one of the first countries to bring together quantum research in a coordinated programme - through their National Centre of Competence in Research (NCRI) vehicle.

Switzerland has established national centres across different themes, including OSIT - Quantum Science & Technology. Creed in 2010 with the goal to advance the fundamental understanding of quantum systems and to establish practical platforms for exploring applications in quantum computing communication, sensing and simulation, the OSIT initiative brings over 30 research groups together from organisations across Switzerland. A notable research activity is in engineered quantum systems, in order engineered topological states and entangled dressed states between a cavity and a qubit [34]. The participating organisations include HPL Zurich, University of Basel, Universite de Geneve, EPFL, IBM and Universite della Sylvarcen Infelom.

On the left of December 2010, the Federal Government and the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) announced that "SPIN-Spin Obits in Silicon" was one of six new NCRIs. For its first phase from August 2020 to July 2024, the NCRI SPIN will receive federal funding of CHF 17m (EIT27m). The goal of SPIN is to develop smt, fast and scalable quantum bits and quantum interconnects such that water-scale quantum circuits can be fabricated by the semiconductor industry [35]. It is carrying out research in electron spin qubits, quantum architectures, and hole spin qubits [35].

## Quantum Centres

As well as participating in national programmes, various universities have dedicated quantum centres. The Basel Quantum Centre of the University Basel is one such example, with research areas including quantum computing, spin qubits and quantum optics. The centre comprises I research groups in theoretical and experimental quantum physics, and is functionally closely connected to the Swiss Nonscience Institute (SNI). The NCRI Quantum Science and Technology, and the NCRI SPIN, allows for inspir funding from the Swiss National Science Foundation and from the European programs including the Quantum Technologies Flagship [36].

The Basel Centre is part of the Georg H. Endress Postdoc cluster, a cross-border collaboration between the University of Basel and the Albert-Ludigs University in Freiburg (Germany). This is a dedicated ten-year initiative to foster and educate outstanding young scientists to provide the academic talent and technology skills for the rapidly developing fields of quantum science and quantum computing, through engaging young scientists in projects involving existing research groups at Basel and Freiburg [37].

There is also notable activity in Zurich ETH Zurich's Quantum Center coordinates the institutions various scientific and structural activities in quantum science and technology, in particular interconnecting research and teaching across ETH Herparts. The Center also serves on ETH Zurich-wide content part for larger projects, including collaborations with industrial partners and funding through Swiss and international grant agencies [138] There is also on Engineering Unit, which engages in collaborations with Swiss and international industries, it promotes the creation of spin-off companies based on its own developments and those of its partner labs at ETH. It fosters the creation of intellectual property and supports developments pursued by individual research groups at ETH in the context of quantum engineering [138]. The Engineering Unit is supported by ETH Zurich through an ETH+ Project, the NCRI GSIT, ETH Zurich Foundation, and its member groups.

Related to this is the ETH-ZPSI Quantum Computing Hub, a research facility jointly operated by ETH Zurich and the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI). PSI is the largest research Institute for natural and engineering sciences in Switzerland, employing 2100 people and with an annual budget of approximately CHF 400 million. The Hub builds on the extensive experience at the Quantum Devices Laboratory and the Twoped Ion Quantum Information group at ETH Zurich and combines it with the broader expertise and resources available at PSI. The aims of the Hub are to scale up to larger scale systems of tens of qubits, adverse materials and control, and to exploit synergies across technologies and the software stock [140].

Both ETH Zurich and PSI are port of the ETH Domoin. The ETH Domoin comprises Switzerland's two federal institutes of technology (FIT) - ETH Zurich and the EPFL in Lausanne - and four research institutes: the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL), the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (Empon) and the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Empon).

EEPFL has its own Center for Quantum Science and Engineering (QSE). The Center promotes and supports collaborative research through the creation of collaborative OSE grants, multidisciplinary education, and innovation, focusing on two pillars: Applied quantum algorithms and data science, and quantum hardware materials and systems. The former looks out fundamental research for the development and improvement of quantum algorithms and the related software infrastructure, to their large-scale implementation. The latter explores new physical implementations of quantum hardware, leveraging the nanofiltration facilities present on campus. In conjunction with EPFL's Stratum Daunched. OSE has launched its Grants for Entrepreneurit Projects in Quantum, aimed at accelerating the journey from lab to mortar through on investment up to CHF 180K over a period of two years [142][143].

Finally, there is the Swiss Quantum Hub (SGH) non-profit organization based in Geneva that describes itself as a Third Turk, Stratum accelerator and Business Services for the Swiss QC community. SGH provides, among other things, publications, training, a startup accelerator programme and provides links to quantum researchers, businesses and investors [144].

## Closing remarks

There is clearly a lot of activity relating to OIT across the European countries investigated in this report. Many countries, following the UK's early example, now have rational programmes and strategies in place, with large amounts of funding being committed to erect this. European cooperation is strong, and countries are leveraging the EUS mechanisms as part of this; the UK has historically been a strong partner in EU projects, and its participation in Horizon Europe and its subsequent effects are uncertain. There is much talk on ecosystem development, both at a national and more localised level, with strong regional clusters forming in many countries. Collaboration between research groups is seen as key, even more so when these are linked to industry and port of an overarching national initiative. The USA, with its strong activity and funding in quantum technologies, has a strong presence throughout the report: China is also notably featured throughout, suggesting that there is some collaboration with European countries, at least at on on academic level.

This report is the first in a series of two - North America and Asia will be covered in detail in the next publication. If you would like to be kept informed of future GCS Hub reports, please subscribe. The raw data behind the figures displayed in this report are available upon request.
