WorldSkills UK foreword

WorldSkills UK commissioned this report to identify the barriers preventing the UK becoming a global leader in advanced manufacturing, and understand how we can play our full role as part of the solution.

takes have never been higher. By tackling persistent skills gaps, strengthening collaboration between education and industry and building a diverse talent pipeline for the manufacturing sector, the UK has a huge opportunity to go-for-growth, level up, reach net zero, and attract more inward investment.

Whilst there's clearly some work to do, I have witnessed so many young people unlock their full potential and achieve enormous success via WorldSkills UK's national and international programmes for manufacturing. With these successes giving them the foundations to go on and provide the world-class skills that the sector so desperately needs.

the success of these young people in every region, engaging the next generation and turbocharging manufacturers', skills providers', and local economies' ability to access and develop world-class advanced manufacturing skills.

Manufacturing in the UK is operating in a global market, and we need to ensure that we are keeping pace. By capitalising on our unique ability to benchmark UK skills against leading nations, I believe that WorldSkills UK can play a key role in helping our fantastic educators keep pace with the world's best and mirror international best practice in how advanced manufacturing skills are taught.

This research tells us once again that we need to fundamentally change the narrative about the nature and opportunity available in manufacturing. By working with partners to enhance our careers programmes, we will tackle negative perceptions of manufacturing we need to find by too many young people, and help the sector overcome the existential challenge of an ageing workforce.

Our research shows that over half of all manufacturers aren't directly engaging with the skills system and we are committed to working with partners from business and education to address this.

I would like to thank Learning and Work Institute for all their work on this report, and also extend my gratitude to all the partners, particularly BAE Systems, that contributed. I will look forward to working with you so the UK can become a world leader in advanced manufacturing, and young people, businesses and the UK economy can reap the rewards.
