## Executive summary

### Introduction

The Employer Skills Survey (ESS) has run biennially since 2011, providing a vital source of intelligence on the skills issues employers face. ESS traditionally has an inward-looking focus assessing the current skills position and skills needs of employers. It has sat alongside the Employer Perspectives Survey, which is primarily outward-looking, covering provision engagement with the wider skills system. In ESS 2019, the two surveys were, in effect, merged, by incorporating EPS questions as modules.1 In total, 81,013 respondents across England, Northern Ireland and Wales responded to the survey.

Footnote 1: Prior to the 2019 survey, the ESS survey, along with its sister survey the UK EPS ran across the UK on alternate years. This means that comparisons over time refer to different survey years depending on whether the measure being referred to originated from the ESS or EPS survey prior to 2019. The report commonly refers to the last two waves of these surveys (i.e. ESS 2015 and 2017 and EPS 2014).

This report focuses on findings relating to skills needs, focusing upon skill-shortage vacancies and skills gaps in the current workforce. It assesses where these skills needs are most keenly felt by employers, which skills in particular are lacking in the workforce and recruitment pool, how employers attempt to address these skills needs as well as considering anticipated future skills needs.

### Where are the current skills bottlenecks?

Overall, 5% of employers reported that they had skill-shortage vacancies (vacancies which are hard to fill because of a lack of the required skills, qualifications or experience) and 13% of employers reported that they had skills gaps among their workforce. These figures were in line with levels in 2017 regarding skills gaps (13%), but represented a slight decrease since 2017 regarding skill-shortage vacancies (6%).

Despite a decrease in the number of vacancies compared with 2017, there was an increase in the number of skill-shortage vacancies, with these skill-shortage vacancies comprising a larger proportion of all vacancies than in 2017 (24%, up from 22%). Similarly, the proportion of the workforce that were considered to be lacking in full proficiency (i.e. to have a skills gap) had also risen, albeit slightly, since 2017 (4.5%, up from 4.3%). This marks a reversal of the gradual decrease in skills gap density from 2011 to 2017 (the figure was 5.5% in 2011). These slight increases in skill-shortage vacancy and skills gap densities were driven by rises in England.

In terms of where these skills needs are felt more sharply, skill-shortage vacancy density (the proportion of vacancies hard to fill because of skill shortages in applicants) was highest in the Construction and Manufacturing sectors, where 36% of vacancies were proving hard-to-fill because of applicants lacking the appropriate skills, qualifications or experience (compared to the 24% average). By occupation, employers faced the greatest challenges in finding suitably skilled candidates for Skilled Trades positions, with nearly half of vacancies in these roles being skill-shortage vacancies (48%). This occupational group also had the largest increase in skill-shortage vacancy density compared with 2017 (up 6 percentage points).

Skills gap density remained highest among the Hotels and Restaurants and Manufacturing sectors (6.9% and 5.8% respectively), with both having similar skills gap densities to levels seen in 2017. In terms of occupation, Elementary Staff experienced the greatest increase in skills gap density compared with 2017 (a 1.7 percentage point increase) and were the occupations with the highest skills gap density (8.0%).

## Current skill demands

A wide range of skills were lacking among applicants. Over four-fifths (84%) of skill-shortage vacancies were at least partially caused by a lack of technical or practical skills (a small decrease from a figure of 88% in 2017); often a lack of specialist skills or knowledge needed to perform the role (63%). Two-thirds (66%) of skill-shortage vacancies were at least partially caused by a lack of people and personal skills, much lower than in 2017 (75%). The most common skill of this type lacking was the ability to manage one's own time and prioritise tasks (45%). Just under a third (30%) of skill-shortage vacancies involved a lack of digital skills.

Skills lacking among the existing workforce tended to match those discussed as lacking among recruits. In terms of technical and practical skills, specialist skills or knowledge required to perform the job role was the most prevalent specific skill lacking among staff (a factor in 53% of all skills gaps). The same proportion of skills gaps were partly due to a lack of operational skills (53%), while a lack of proficiency in complex analytical skills contributed to just under half of all skills gaps (47%). All three of these were most likely to be cited as skills deficiencies within the Financial Services sector. The most common people and soft skills lacking were related to self-management skills (72% of all skills gaps), including the inability among staff to manage their own time or prioritise tasks (60% of all skills gaps) or to manage their feelings and the feelings of others (49%). A lack of management and leadership skills were also a factor for approaching three-fifths (57%) of skills gaps. A lack of digital skills was a factor in around two-fifths of skills gaps (38%).

There was wide variation in the skills lacking among applicants and the current workforce by sector and occupation, reflecting very different skills challenges.

## Addressing skills shortages

Although transient factors (such as staff having been recruited who are not yet fully trained or experienced in their new role) regularly contributed to skills gaps (79%), they were rarely the exclusive cause of them (20%). Consequently, skills gaps were not exclusively caused by factors that would be expected to alleviate over time, and this was reflected in the fact that many employers actively took issues to address skills needs.

Unsurprisingly, the key difference in terms of the way that establishments tried to address skill-shortage vacancies and skills gaps related to the direction that employers looked when trying to address them: generally action was directed externally to address skill-shortage vacancies, and internally to address skills gaps. Consequently, the most common actions taken to overcome skill-shortage vacancies was to utilise new recruitment methods or channels (37%) or to increase advertising or recruitment spend (37%). Contrastingly, establishments tried to overcome skills gaps in their workforce most often by increasing training activity (64%), supervising staff more (55%), conducting more appraisals (46%) or implementing a mentoring scheme (45%).

New analysis for 2019 shows employers with skill-shortage vacancies tended to place more emphasis on each factor that they considered when recruiting staff than those that did not have skill-shortage vacancies, and were also more likely to utilise each different recruitment method and strategy during their recruitment process. Similarly, employers with skills needs were more likely to indicate that they had engaged with national skills policy initiatives, including taking on apprentices, trainees, expressing interest in offering work placements through the T-Levels scheme.

## Future skills requirements

Around two-thirds of employers anticipated the requirement to develop the skills of their workforce in the coming year (64%). The most common reasons for expecting to need to upskill their staff were in response to new legislative or regulatory requirements (42%), because of the introduction of new technologies or equipment (41%), the development of new products and services (35%) and the introduction of new working practices (35%).

The profile of skills that employers anticipated needing to develop was broadly similar to the profile of skills lacking among applicants and the current workforce. One key difference however was digital skills: these skills were more prominently a part of employers anticipation of upskilling requirements, perhaps reflecting the pace of change of digital skills requirements. The most common skills that were identified by employers as requiring upskilling were grouped as operational skills (52%), specialist skills or knowledge (50%), self-management skills (49%), management or leadership skills (48%) and digital skills (47%).

## 1 Introduction

### Background to the Employer Skills Survey

From 2010-2017, the Employer Skills Survey (ESS) sat alongside the Employer Perspectives Survey (EPS) to produce insights that complemented each other, with the two surveys run in alternate years (EPS was last conducted UK-wide in 2016). The focus of the Employer Perspectives Survey was primarily outward-looking, covering engagement with the education and skills system, whereas the Employer Skills Survey had a more inward-looking focus assessing the current skills position and skills needs of employers. For ESS 2019, the two surveys were in effect merged. The 2019 iteration of ESS is the fifth in a series conducted biennially since 2011.2 For the 2019 iteration, the survey covered England, Wales and Northern Ireland rather than the whole UK as in previous years.

Footnote 2: The 2011, 2013 and 2015 editions of the survey were commissioned by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES). Responsibility for the ESS series transferred to the Department for Education following the closure of UKCES in 2016. The government has conducted employer surveys on skills and training since 1990, starting with the Skill Needs in Britain surveys. See Appendix B for more details on related predecessor surveys.

A separate 'core' report covers the key ESS measures including recruitment and skill-shortage vacancies, skills challenges among the workforce; and training and workforce development activity. This report specifically explores employer skills needs and provides a more in-depth examination of some of the factors reported in the core report. This report covers the skills lacking in applicants and within the existing workforce, the causes of these skills challenges, the ways that employers have tried to address them, and an indication of potential future skills challenges.

It should be noted that the results presented in the report relate to employer skills needs prior to the Covid-19 pandemic: while the findings still provide an important source of labour market intelligence, clearly the economic landscape has changed significantly since survey fieldwork was conducted.

## Policy background

The period immediately prior to the fieldwork period for ESS 2019 was marked by continued economic growth,3 and high levels of job creation, with the employment rate at the end of the second quarter of 2019 at 76.1%, at that time the joint highest since records began.4 Another key characterisation of the UK economy during this period was its productivity gap relative to international competitors (Taylor, M., 2017). According to the most recent ONS estimates, the UK had the lowest productivity rate of all G7 countries except Italy.5 In the second quarter of 2019 output per hour fell by 0.5%, the largest quarterly fall in productivity in five years.6

Footnote 4: ONS. Labour Market Overview: June 2019 (2019)

Footnote 5: ONS. International comparisons of productivity: 2016 (2018)

Footnote 6: ONS. Labour productivity. UK: April to June 2019, (2019)

Workplace skills as a driver of economic growth, and productivity growth specifically, remain central to government policy. As we enter a period of economic and labour market uncertainty, ensuring the workforce has the right skills will be more important than ever to aid recovery. While skills are recognised as a key contributor to productivity growth, it is widely held that (prior to the Covid-19 pandemic) the UK had a skills deficit. The Department for Education's 'Technical education reform: the case for change' (July 2016) reported that 'it is increasingly evident from international surveys that our current skills system is failing to fully meet the country's needs across a range of skills', including numeracy and literacy skills, and intermediate skills. It cited the OECD's forecast that the UK would fall to 28th out of 33 OECD countries for intermediate skills by 2020. The report also discussed how skills shortages were posing significant challenges to employers, but argued that at the same time there was a lack of employer engagement and investment in education and training.7

Footnote 7: Ofe. Technical Education Reform: the case for change (2016)

These aspects of government policy and the broader understanding of the skills landscape in the UK act as crucial context for ESS 2019. This report considers the current skills needs of employers by considering skill levels in the workforce and among applicants to vacancies, as well as skills areas that employers believe they will need to upskill among their workforce in the near future. This analysis sheds light onto the current and future skills challenges that employers were facing pre-pandemic, as well as the types of action that employers were pursuing to address these issues.

## Methodological overview

This section briefly summarises the key features of the methodology for ESS 2019, further detail of which can be found in the published technical report on the gov.uk website. As in previous iterations of ESS, the survey was carried out in two parts, both of which were conducted by telephone: a core survey of establishments and a follow-up survey looking at the investment employers had made in providing training to employees in the previous 12 months (the "Investment in Training Survey").8 This report does not present findings from the Investment in Training Survey.

Footnote 8: More information about the methodology for the Investment in Training Survey can be found in the ‘Training and Workforce Development’ thematic report that will be published alongside this report.

### Sampling

The population covered by the survey comprised employers with at least two staff on the payroll in England, Northern Ireland and Wales. The survey is conducted at the establishment level (rather than at an organisational level)9. Sole traders with a single person on the payroll were excluded.

Footnote 9: i.e. multiple sites (or premises) of a larger organisation were in scope for the research and were thus counted separately for sampling purposes. This was in recognition of the influence that local labour markets have on skill issues and the fact that skills issues are felt most acutely at the site level.

The survey covered all sectors of the economy (the commercial, public and charitable spheres). The profile of this population was established through Office for National Statistics (ONS) data from the March 2018 Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR), the most up to date business population figures available at the time that sampling was conducted for the survey.

The sample of establishments was primarily sourced from the commercial data supplier Market Location. This was supplemented by records supplied directly through the IDBR to improve coverage of establishments in specific sectors and parts of sectors that are underrepresented in Market Location's database.

Quotas for the main survey were set by size within sector separately for Wales, Northern Ireland and eight English regions, while in one region, the West Midlands, a slightly different approach was adopted. In this region a Random Probability Sampling method was trialled, with no quotas and instead interviews were attempted with all sample records loaded.

### Questionnaire

ESS 2019 was designed to merge the ESS and EPS surveys to provide greater efficiency and to enhance the potential for cross analysis. The surveys were required to be combined in such a way that interview length stayed below 25 minutes: a longer survey would have impacted on response rates and the quality of information provided. To avoid an excessively long questionnaire the merger of two surveys required more extensive modularisation of the questionnaire than undertaken previously.

Questions that were included in the merged questionnaire were designed to be as consistent as possible with previous versions of the same question in order to ensure comparability over time.

### Fieldwork

Fieldwork for the core survey was undertaken between May and December 2019 and involved 81,013 interviews. Fieldwork was conducted by three research agencies (IFF Research, BMG Research and Ipsos MORI). An overall response rate of 41% was achieved for the main survey.

### Weighting

Findings from the core survey have been weighted and grossed up to accurately represent the total population of establishments in England, Northern Ireland and Wales with at least two people on their payroll, calculated using the March 2019 IDBR population statistics. This has been done on a size, sector and geographic basis. Separate weights were generated which allow findings to be presented (a) based on the number of workplaces reporting a particular experience, and (b) based on the number of employees and/or job roles affected by different challenges. For questions that were modularised (i.e. only asked of a random selected sample of respondents), modular versions of the workplace and employee weights were created.

## Report coverage

This report covers:

* Where there are 'bottlenecks' and particular pockets of skills shortage, including a comparison of the incidence, volume and density of skill shortages and how these differ by geography, sector and occupation;
* Specific skills that are lacking in the currently available labour market, as well as internally among the workforce, considering the types of skills that are in demand by employers;* The causes of skill shortage vacancies and skills gaps (including the types of skill lacking) as well as the steps employers have been taking to address them;
* Whether employer recruitment strategies help or hinder the occurrence of skill-shortage vacancies, and the extent to which employers with skills needs engage with skills policy initiatives (e.g. apprenticeships, traineeships, etc.); and
* A view on potential skills needs over the coming 12 months (from the time at which the survey was conducted), including areas where employers anticipated future requirements to upskill their workforce.

## Reporting conventions

The terms "establishment", "employer" and "workplace" are used interchangeably throughout this report to avoid excessive repetition.

Throughout the report unweighted base figures are shown on tables and charts to give an indication of the statistical reliability of the figures.

Prior to the 2019 survey, the ESS survey, along with its sister survey the UK EPS ran across the UK on alternate years. This means that comparisons over time refer to different survey years depending on whether the measure being referred to originated from the ESS or EPS survey prior to 2019. The report commonly refers to the last two waves of these surveys (i.e. ESS 2015 and 2017 and EPS 2014 and 2016).

In tables, "zero" is denoted as a dash ("-"); and an asterisk is used ("") if the figure is larger than zero but less than 0.5%.

Throughout the report, figures with a base size of fewer than 30 establishments are not reported (a double asterisk, "", is displayed instead), and figures with a base size of 30 to 49 are italicised and should be treated with caution.

The scale and scope of data collected in ESS 2019 means that it is a valuable research resource supporting detailed and complex statistical analysis of the inter-relationships between employer characteristics and their practices and experiences. The findings presented in this report reflect a descriptive exploration of the data. All differences referred to in the text are statistically significant at the 95% level of confidence. Significance testing on employer measures use the unweighted respondent base, while employment measures, and density measures such as the proportion of the workforce with skills gaps and skills-shortage vacancy density, have been calculated on the basis of the unweighted employment (or vacancy) base. Further statistical information can be found in Appendix E.

Usually survey data on occupations are discussed at one-digit standard occupational classification (SOC) level. However, on occasion to aid analysis, the report discusses occupations at a broader classification of high-skill, middle-skill, service-intensive and labour-intensive roles, as shown in Appendix D.

## 2 Where are the current skills bottlenecks?

### Chapter summary

Overall, 5% of employers reported having skill-shortage vacancies at the time of the interview and 13% reported that there were skills gaps in their workforce.

Despite an overall fall in the number of vacancies compared with 2017, the number of skill-shortage vacancies in 2019 was higher than at any point since 2011. Almost a quarter (24%) of all vacancies were skill-shortage vacancies (up from 22% in the 2013 to 2017 period).

The proportion of the workforce that employers considered to be lacking full proficiency (i.e. had a skills gap) had also risen since 2017, albeit a relatively slight increase (from 4.3% to 4.5%). This did, however, mark a reversal of the gradual decrease observed from 2011 to 2017 (from a high of 5.5% in 2011).

In terms of the geographic profile of skills challenges, increases in skill-shortage vacancy density and skills gap density were predominantly driven by increases in England, where both figures rose compared with 2017. At a more disaggregated level there were highly localised pockets of skills bottlenecks, highlighting that these pressures can be felt in very specific areas of the country. In some instances, local areas with very challenging skills needs bordered areas with relatively low levels of skill needs.

Skills needs were particularly prevalent in certain sectors. Skill-shortage vacancy density was highest in the Construction sector (36%, the same as in 2017) and in Manufacturing (36%, a large increase from 29% in 2017, indicating growing skill-shortages in this sector). Skill-shortage vacancy density was lowest in the Public Administration and Financial Services sectors (13% in each case). The sectoral profile of skills gap density has remained relatively consistent over time, remaining highest in the Hotels and Restaurants sector (6.9% of the workforce were considered to have a skills gap) and lowest in the Education sector (2.8%).

By occupation, Skilled Trades roles have historically had the highest skill-shortage vacancy density; this continued in 2019. Such roles also saw the biggest increase in skill-shortage vacancy density since 2017 (48% up from 42%). Elementary occupations experienced the greatest increase in skills gap density compared with 2017 (1.7 percentage points) and were the occupational group with the highest skills gap density (8.0%), while managerial occupations had the lowest (2.2%).

## Introduction

ESS 2019 provides a detailed understanding of the level and nature of employer demand for new staff and the ability of the labour market to meet this demand, particularly in relation to applicants having the skills and qualifications employers require. In addition to this, it provides understanding of the proportion of the current workforce that employers consider to be fully proficient. These two key measures represent the current skills needs bottlenecks in the labour market and workforce. The key measures used in this chapter and throughout this report are:

Skill-shortage vacancies are defined within ESS as any vacancies that are proving hard to fill due to a lack of skills, experience or qualifications among applicants. ESS measures skill-shortage vacancies that employers are aware of. It would not include hard-to-fill vacancies that receive no applicants which could be the result of a skill shortage, especially where the job description has clearly stated high requirements. Equally, a reported skill-shortage vacancy - i.e. one which attracts applicants but none with the right skills - may be caused by relative unattractiveness of the role to a pool of potential applicants _who do_ possess the right skills. Aspects of the role which influence would-be applicants, such as pay or working conditions, may not be recognised by the employer and therefore may not be represented in these findings.

Skills gaps are defined as occurring when employees within a company do not possess all of the required skills to be fully proficient at their job. These can arise as a result of not being able to find suitably skilled applicants, or intentionally taking on recruits who are not fully experienced in order to train them up to the employer's way of working, but can also arise for a host of other reasons such as the skills needed within an establishment changing. Some skills gaps may be by their nature temporary, for example where new staff have been recruited who are not yet fully trained or experienced in their new role: in this report these causes of skills gaps are considered to be 'transient'. However, others can be more persistent and a result of under-investment in training and development, staff reluctance to develop existing skills or develop new ones, or high staff turnover. Persistent skills gaps can hinder an establishment's ability to function effectively and harm its productivity, profitability and ability to innovate in terms of internal processes and regarding new products or services.

It is worth bearing in mind that the survey only captures the skills gaps that employers are aware of and report. Arguably, employers that pay little attention to their employees' skills and the needs of their establishment may be less likely to report skill gaps. Some commentators have termed these 'latent skill gaps'.10

Footnote 10: Terence Hogarth, Rob Wilson, Skills Matter: a Synthesis of Research on the Extent. Causes and Implications of Skill Deficiencies (2001)

This chapter explores the incidence of skill-shortage vacancies and skills gaps within the existing workforce at an overall level, by sector and by geography, focusing on areas of the current employer landscape with skills challenges that may be considered bottlenecks.

## Overall picture - skill-shortage vacancies and skills gaps

Only a relatively small minority reported that they had skill-shortage vacancies at the time of the interview (5%) or had any staff that were not fully proficient at their job (13%). Very few employers reported that they had both skill-shortage vacancies and skills gaps (2%).

Slightly fewer establishments had skill-shortage vacancies in 2019 (5%) than in 2017 (6%). As shown in Figure 2-1, this represents a break from the trend of generally increasing incidence of skill-shortage vacancies since 2011. Conversely, the proportion of employers who reported that at least some of their staff were not fully proficient has remained stable since 2017 (13%), following a gradual decline since 2011 (17%).

Despite total vacancies falling (from 932,000 in 2017 to 877,000 in 2019), there was a small increase in the volume of skill-shortage vacancies (from 209,000 to 214,000). The combination of these factors saw skill-shortage vacancy density - the proportion of vacancies which are skill-shortage vacancies - increase to 24% (from 22% in 2017). This represents an nine percentage-point increase since 2011, when only 16% of vacancies were proving hard to fill due to difficulties in finding applicants with appropriate skills, qualifications or experience. This sustained increase in skill-shortage vacancy density is likely to reflect the tightening labour market (prior to Covid-19),11 both in terms of a continued reduction in unemployment and reduced access to migrant labour since 2016.

Skills gap density (the proportion of the workforce lacking full proficiency) also rose, marking the first increase in skills gap density since 2011, albeit a relatively slight increase. Skills gap density had decreased during the period 2011 to 2017 (from 5.5% to 4.3%), while the figure rose slightly to 4.5% in 2019.

Across England, Northern Ireland and Wales there were in total 214,300 skill-shortage vacancies (an increase compared to 208,700 in 2017), while 1.25 million employees were felt to be lacking proficiency (an increase compared to 1.15 million in 2017).

The likelihood that an establishment had a skill-shortage vacancy increased with size, from 2% of employers with 2 to 4 employees to 25% of those with 250 or more employees. In the same way, the proportion of establishments that reported any skills gaps among their staff increased with size: from 5% of establishments with 2 to 4 employees to around two-fifths (39%) of those with 250 or more employees. These changes are perhaps unsurprising, given that larger workforces offer more opportunity for skills gaps to occur and tend to correlate with greater recruitment activity and therefore offer a higher likelihood of skill-shortage vacancies too.

Although smaller employers were less likely to experience skills-shortage vacancies, as in 2017 the density of skill-shortage vacancies was higher among small establishments than large establishments. Over a third of vacancies in establishments with fewer than five employees were proving hard-to-fill due to skill-shortages (34%), compared to a fifth (20%) among establishments with 100 or more employees. The density of skills gaps was lower among smaller establishments. Establishments with 2 to 4 employees reported a smaller proportion of their workforce as not fully proficient (2.2%) than those with 5 to 24 employees (4.3%) or 25 or more employees (4.9%). This was a similar pattern to findings in 2017 (2 to 4 employees: 2.4%, 5 to 24: 4.2% and 25 or more: 4.6%).

Table A.2.7 and Table A.2.8 in Appendix A provide a full breakdown of the incidence, number and density of skills gaps by size of establishment and sector. Table A.2.9 in Appendix A provides the density of skills gap by country.

## Pockets of skill-shortage

### Skills needs by country

It was more common for employers to report that they had skill-shortage vacancies or skills gaps in England (17%) or Wales (17%) than Northern Ireland (13%).

As demonstrated in Figure 2-2, the fall in skill-shortage vacancy incidence was driven by changes in Northern Ireland and Wales, where the incidence of skill-shortage vacancies decreased from 5% to 4% and 6% to 5% respectively. In England, the incidence of skill-shortage vacancies remained unchanged, at 6%.

In terms of skill-shortage vacancy density, the picture is not uniform: while the density of skill-shortage vacancies increased in England and Northern Ireland compared with 2017, it fell in Wales (where the number of skill-shortage vacancies remained relatively constant while the total number of vacancies increased).

In Northern Ireland, the skill shortage pressures that were building in 2017 were sustained. While historically employers in Northern Ireland have found vacancies much less hard to fill than the rest of the UK, in 2019 the density of skill-shortage vacancies in Northern Ireland were broadly in line with the average (22% compared with 24%).

**Figure 2-2 Incidence and density of skill-shortage vacancies (SSVs), by country**

Unlike with skill-shortage vacancies, the slight increase in skills gap density since 2017 was driven by changes in England. Although there were falls in skills gap density between 2017 and 2019 in Northern Ireland (from 3.8% to 3.3%) and Wales (from 4.7% to 4.0%), the overall picture was driven by the slight rise in in England (from 4.3% to 4.6%). In each nation skills gap density is lower or at the same level in 2019 than in 2015, as shown in Figure 2-3.

## Skills needs by Local Area

A key advantage of the ESS survey with its large sample size is that skills needs can be examined at a local level - either at the Local Authority (referred to as "local areas") or Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) level.12 By considering this local data it is possible to identify specific areas of the country where employers have reported greater skills needs, and to allow local areas gain a better understanding of the specific skills challenges in their area to allow a targeted local policy response. This section illustrates the type of local level data available and some of the wide variations in skills needs around the country. The detailed data tables and slide packs published alongside the ESS reports can be used to do more in-depth analysis of specific areas.13

Footnote 12: Due to low base sizes, some of the very small Local Authorities have been merged with larger adjoining LAs. Although no longer technically in use operationally, as in previous years, “Local Education Authority” definitions have been used to guide this merging.

Footnote 13: Despite base sizes at a local level being large enough to allow for robust subgroup analysis, it is worth exercising slightly more caution with results at a local level as some of the more stark differences could relate to smaller base sizes. Any data based upon base sizes below 30 has been suppressed throughout this section of the report.

The local areas with the highest density of skill-shortage vacancies were Lamboth, Luton, Middlesbrough and Poole, in each of these areas nearly half (48%) of all vacancies were proving hard to fill due to skill-shortages. The areas with the lowest density of skill-shortage vacancies were Walsall and Wokingham, where in each case just 7% of vacancies were skill-shortage vacancies.

The extent to which variation in skill-shortage vacancy density can exist at a local level is highlighted by the fact that Hartlepool, which is adjacent to Middlesbrough - with one of the highest skill-shortage vacancy densities in England - has a skill-shortage vacancy density of only 14%, significantly below the English average. Table 13 in Appendix A demonstrates the 10 LEAs with the highest and lowest skill-shortage vacancy densities.

Turning to Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs), the LEP with the highest density of skill-shortage vacancies was Lancashire, where more than a third (36%) of vacancies were skill-shortage vacancies. The LEPs with the lowest density of skill-shortage vacancies were Sheffield City Region (19%); York, North Yorkshire and East Riding (19%); Cornwall and Isles of Scilly (20%); Derby, Derbyshire, Nottingham and Nottinghamshire (20%); and Leicester and Leicestershire (20%). Table 14 in Appendix A lists the 10 LEPs with the highest and lowest skill-shortage densities. The 5 highest and lowest skill-shortage vacancies at an LEP level are presented on a map below (Figure 2-4), with additional colour coding to show regional skill-shortage vacancy density.

**Figure 2-4 Map of LEPs in England with particularly high or low skill-shortage vacancy densities**

Considering skills gaps among the existing workforce at a local level, three local areas stood out as having particularly high skills gap density figures: Blackburn with Darwin (11.3%), Knowsley (10.1%) and Reading (8.9%). Conversely, three local areas were found to have fewer than 2% of their workforce lacking in full proficiency: Wokingham (1.5%), Tower Hamlets (1.8%) and Hartlepool (1.9%). Again, strong localised variation in skills gap density can be demonstrated by the fact that Reading and Wokingham, neighbouring areas, were found to have among the highest and lowest skills gap density figures in England. Table A.2.15 in Appendix A demonstrates the 10 LEAs with the highest and lowest skills gap densities.

When analysing skills gap density by LEP, three had densities that stood out as being substantially higher than average: Leicester and Leicestershire (6.1%), Liverpool City Region (5.9%) and Greater Cambridge and Greater Peterborough (5.8%). Conversely, four LEPs stood out as having particularly low skills gap density figures: Black Country (3.0%), Stoke-on-Trent and Staffordshire (3.1%), Greater Birmingham and Solihull (3.5%) and London (3.6%). Table A.2.16 in Appendix A lists LEPs, highlighting those with the highest and lowest skills gap densities, while the 5 highest and lowest are presented on a map, with additional colour coding to demonstrate regional skills gap density levels, in Figure 2-5 below.

**Figure 2-5 Map of LEPs in England with particularly high or low skills gap densities**

## Sectoral distribution of skills needs

As well as looking locally, the data allows us to look at the sectoral distribution of skills needs (the accompanying ESS data tables also allow an analysis of sectoral needs within local areas). When considering the proportion of employers that had skill-shortage vacancies or skills gaps, employers classified as within the Primary Sector and Utilities and Information & Communications sectors were the least likely to have either skill-shortage (both 11%). Contrastingly, the highest proportion of establishments reporting either skill-shortage vacancies or skills gaps were found in the Public Administration (25%), Hotels & Restaurants (23%), Manufacturing (22%) Education (21%) and Health & Social Work (21%) sectors. Table 2-1 below shows the proportion of employers within each sector that reported each type of skills shortages.

The experience of skill-shortage vacancies varied by sector. Reflecting the relative size of the sectors in employment terms, skill-shortage vacancies were most numerous in the Business Services and Health and Social Work sectors. Skill-shortage vacancy density, however, was highest in the Construction and Manufacturing sectors, where over a third of vacancies were proving hard to fill due to difficulties in finding applicants with appropriate skills, qualifications or experience (36%).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c|c|c|c} \hline  & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Hes \& Stoll.} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Hes \& Stoll.} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Hes \& Stoll.} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Hes \& Stoll.} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Hes \& Stoll.} \\  & Base & vacancy & & & & & & & \\  & (n) & (\%) & (\%) & (\%) & (\%) & (\%) & (\%) \\ \hline

\end{table}
Table 2-1 Skills needs by sectorThe sectoral pattern of skill-shortage vacancy density, in terms of the ordering of sectors from highest to lowest density (as in Figure 2-6, above) was broadly similar to both 2017 and 2015: Construction and Manufacturing remained among those most affected by skill-shortage vacancies, and Public Administration and Financial Services remained among those least affected (despite Public Administration seeing proportionately the largest increase in the number of overall vacancies, indicating that the increased volume of vacancies in this sector had not at the time of interview led to significant challenges in terms of finding applicants with suitable skills).

There were, however, some notable changes in the density of skill-shortage vacancies within sectors, with increased densities in:

* Manufacturing (from 29% in 2017 to 36%);
* Health and Social Work (from 21% to 25%);
* Business Services (from 24% to 27%);
* Wholesale and Retail (from 19% to 22%); and
* Hotels and Restaurants (from 17% to 21%).

The sectors with the biggest decreases in skill-shortage vacancy density since 2017 were Primary Sector and Utilities (from 36% to 31%), Information and Communications (from 28% to 23%), and Financial Services (from 17% to 13%).

Table A.2.1 in Appendix A provides a detailed breakdown of skill-shortage vacancies by country, size of establishment and sector.

Turning to skills gap density, it is clear that there is a different pattern when comparing sectors with high skill-shortage vacancy and those with skills gaps densities; sectors with particularly high skill-shortage vacancy densities did not necessarily have particularly high skills gap densities. As well as this, the slight overall increase in the proportion of the workforce that was not fully proficient from 2017 to 2019 was broadly reflected across sectors, as shown in Figure 2-7. The sectors with the highest and lowest skills gap densities were broadly consistent with findings in 2017. Hotels and Restaurants (6.9%) and Manufacturing (5.8%) remained the two sectors with the highest proportions of their workforces lacking full proficiency, with the skills gap density in both increasing slightly since 2017, while Health & Social Work (3.3%) and Education (2.8%) remained the sectors with the lowest skills gap densities.

Two sectors saw particularly noteworthy changes in their skills gap densities:

* Public Administration saw a particularly large increase in skills gap density from 3.8% in 2017 to 5.3% of the workforce, although this was still lower than in 2015 (6.9%).
* In contrast, the Financial Services sector saw a marked decrease in skills gap density, falling from 5.0% in 2017 to 3.8% in 2019. This was accompanied by a 2% contraction in workforce size, and it may be the case that this reduction in employment has disproportionately affected staff lacking full proficiency (i.e. fully proficient staff were more likely to be retained).

Although skills gap _density_ was highest in the Hotels and Restaurants and the Manufacturing sectors, the highest _number_ of skills gaps existed in the Business Services sector (249,800) and the Wholesale and Retail sector (218,000 skills gaps). Together these two sectors accounted for 38% of all skills gaps, slightly more than their combined share of total employment (35%).

Despite having the lowest skills gap density overall, Northern Ireland had a particularly high density of skills gaps in the Manufacturing sector (8.3%). In Wales too, Manufacturing had the highest skills gap density (8.3%) although the figure was also high in the Hotels and Restaurants sector (7.2%).

Table A.2.7, Table A.2.8 and Table A.2.9 in Appendix A provide a detailed breakdown of skills gaps broken down by country, size and sector.

### Occupational distribution of skills needs

By occupation, employers were most likely to have experienced skills-related difficulties in recruitment when recruiting for Skilled Trades positions. Nearly half of vacancies for such roles were proving hard to fill for skills-related reasons (a skill-shortage vacancy density of 48%). This occupation has had the highest density of skill-shortage vacancies in all previous iterations of the ESS series, and the skills situation has intensified in 2019, with skill-shortage vacancy density increasing by the highest amount of all occupation groups (from 42% to 48%).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:32]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5354]

### Skill-shortage vacancies by job role

It is also possible to examine skill-shortage vacancies in terms of detailed, specific job roles (using 4-digit Standard Occupational Classification code level)14 rather than the broad classifications used to date in this report.

Footnote 14: It is not possible to do conduct such granular analysis regarding skills gaps, as the survey grouped occupations at a one digit level in this section.

The specific job role with the highest volume of skill-shortage vacancies was care workers and home carers, with 15,300 skill-shortage vacancies, constituting 7.1% of all skill-shortage vacancies. This largely reflects the very high level of vacancies in this job role, as the proportion of care workers and home carers vacancies which are linked to skill-shortages is only slightly higher than average, at 27%.

The job role which made up the second highest volume of skill-shortage vacancies was nurses, with the 9,100 skill-shortage vacancies for nurses comprising 4.3% of all skill-shortage vacancies. Skill-shortage vacancies made up a higher proportion of nursing vacancies: over one-third (37%) of nurse vacancies were linked to skill shortages. In the light of the pivotal role played by both care workers and nurses in the response to COVID-19, the significant proportion of skill-shortage vacancies in these roles - with over one-in-ten skill-shortage vacancies relating to either care work or nursing - is of particular significance.

The job role with the highest skill-shortage vacancy density was classified as carpenters and joiners, for which two-thirds of vacancies were proving to be hard-to-fill due to skill-shortages (66%). Figure 2-10 below shows the five job roles with the highest and lowest skill-shortage vacancy densities, while Table A.2.17 in Appendix A provides the 10 specific job roles with the highest and lowest skill-shortage vacancy densities as well as the bases for these findings.15

Footnote 15: The job roles that are provided in Figure 2-8 only include those for which we had a base size of 50.

## Figure 2-10 The job roles with the highest and lowest skill-shortage vacancy densities

### Skills needs by occupation within sector

The previous section looked at the density of skill-shortage vacancies by sector and occupation separately. Exploring the density of skill-shortage vacancies by occupations _within_ sectors provides a more detailed picture of where employers struggle to recruit the skills they need.

Though care should be taken not to over-extrapolate because of the relatively small base sizes in places, Table 2-2 details the skill-shortage vacancy density by occupation within sector. Many of these pockets of skill shortages have proved to be persistent over time. The much higher than average density of skill-shortage vacancies for Skilled Trades has been evident in a number of sectors (such as Manufacturing, Construction and Primary Sector and Utilities) across the ESS series.

Skill-shortage vacancy density has also remained high for Machine Operatives in the Construction and Transport and Storage sectors; for Professional occupations in Construction, Manufacturing, Information and Communications, and Health and Social Work; and for Elementary Staff in Primary Sector and Utilities.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5357]

Some pockets of skill-shortage vacancies are either newly emerging, or have sharpened since 2017:17

Footnote 17: Only ‘pockets’ where the total number of skill-shortage vacancies is over 1,000 are discussed in this section.

* Skilled Trades in the Manufacturing sector (including job roles such as 'Machine setters / tool makers') is now the highest density pocket of skill-shortage vacancies, with over three-in-five (61%) vacancies in this sector proving hard-to-fill for skills related reasons (up from 40% in 2017);
* a trend which is reflected in reports of recruitment difficulties within the NHS which have been acknowledged by NHS Improvement;18 and
* Associate Professionals in the Construction sector ('Building and engineering technicians'), up to 43% from 27% in 2017.

There are a small number of occupations within sectors where the density of skill-shortage vacancies has fallen compared to 2017, most notably: Machine Operatives within Primary Sector and Utilities (from 48% to 27%), including job roles such as 'Agricultural machinery drivers'.

There were also some particularly marked occupational patterns within sectors regarding skills gap density, as shown in Table 2-3.

Skills gap density among Elementary Staff was the highest of all occupations, peaking within this group among staff in the Business Services (12.3%) and Manufacturing (10.7%) services. These are pockets of particularly high skills gap densities that are unique to 2019, having been much lower in findings during the 2017 ESS (6.6% and 5.9% respectively). In 2017, the highest skills gap density was found in Sales and Customer Services staff within the Primary Sector and Utilities sector (19.8%), which had fallen to below average skills gap density in 2019 (3.4%).

Table A.2.9 and Table A.2.8 in Appendix A provide detailed breakdowns of skills gap density by occupation within country and sector respectively.

## 3 Which skills are lacking among applicants and the workforce?

### Chapter summary

A wide range of skills were lacking among applicants. Over four-fifths (84%) of skill-shortage vacancies were at least partially caused by a lack of technical or practical skills (a small decrease from a figure of 88% in 2017); specifically a lack of specialist skills or knowledge needed to perform the role was a partial cause of nearly two-thirds (63%) of skill-shortage vacancies. Overall, 30% of skill-shortage vacancies were caused at least in part by a lack of digital skills.

Two-thirds (66%) of skill-shortage vacancies were at least partially caused by a lack of people and personal skills, much lower than in 2017 (75%). The most common skill of this type lacking was the ability to manage one's own time and prioritise tasks. However, as with most people and personal skills, the proportion of skill-shortage vacancies at least partially attributed to this (45%) was lower than in 2017 (50%).

The skills lacking among employers within the existing workforce remained relatively consistent with findings in previous years, with skills relating to self-management remaining the most prevalent (72%). The most commonly lacking skills were the ability to manage their own time and to prioritise tasks (a factor in 60% of skills gaps), specialist skills or knowledge needed to perform the role (53%) and team working (50%). Digital skills were a factor in around two-fifths of skills gaps (38%), with the most common skill lacking being basic digital skills (47% of digital skills gaps related to basic digital skills).

When looking at sectors and occupations, there was unsurprisingly a wide variance in the kinds of skills lacking among applicants and the workforce. Some of these findings were more expected than others, such as sales and customer service skills being a key skills gaps among Sales and Customer Service occupations, while others were perhaps more surprising such as the extent to which complex analytical skills contributed to skill-shortage vacancies among Primary Sector and Utilities employers.

### Introduction

This chapter focuses upon which skills are currently in demand among employers either because of a perceived lack of availability in the current labour market or within their current workforce. The skills that are considered can be broadly grouped into three categories:The individual skills within these broader groupings are also grouped into smaller, more thematic groupings, as defined in Table B.1, Table B.2 and Table B.3 in Appendix B

This chapter considers each skill and the level at which they can be considered lacking among applicants and the current workforce, before considering the profile of the same factors (internally and externally) by sector and occupation.

## Skills lacking in the available labour market

Employers with skill-shortage vacancies were read a list of skills and asked, for each occupation in which they reported skill-shortage vacancies,20 which skills were lacking. The specific skills that employers perceive to be lacking among applicants have been broadly grouped into the three categories outlined in the introduction to this chapter: technical and practical skills, people and personal skills and digital skills.

Footnote 20: Up to a maximum of two occupations chosen at random.

### Technical and practical skills lacking among applicants

Looking first at technical and practical skills, 84% of skill-shortage vacancies were at least partially caused by a lack of technical or practical skills in applicants. This represents a decrease from a figure of 88% in 2017. Of the specific technical and practical skills lacking, a lack of specialist skills or knowledge needed to perform the role was the most commonly reported skill shortage. In line with 2017, this was mentioned as being at least a partial cause of nearly two-thirds of skill-shortage vacancies (63%).

Among the other technical and practical skills lacking, it is possible to group some of the skills. A lack of 'operational skills', including knowledge of products and services offered and/or knowledge of how the organisation works, has become relatively more prevalent, being at least partially responsible for 45% of skill-shortage vacancies (compared with 43% in 2017). As in 2017, shortages of such skills were especially prevalent among employers in the Wholesale and Retail sector, and appear to be increasingly prevalent among employers in the Financial Services sector (in both sectors a lack of such skills was at least partially responsible for 53% of skill-shortage vacancies; in Financial Services this represented an increase from 42% in 2017).

A lack of 'complex analytical skills' remains common. Approaching half (45%) of skill-shortage vacancies were attributed to a lack of this group of skills, although they were slightly less prevalent than in 2017 (48%). Within this grouping, the most prevalent was a lack of complex problem-solving skills (39%). A lack of complex analytical skills was most prevalent in the Information and Communications and Public Administration sectors, where they contributed to nearly three-fifths (58%) of skill-shortage vacancies.

A lack of basic level skills, defined here as basic numerical or basic IT skills, contributed to a third of skill-shortage vacancies (34%), representing a slight decrease from 2017 (39%). These skills contributed to a larger proportion of skill-shortage vacancies for the following groups of employers: those in Northern Ireland (46%, compared to 38% in Wales and 33% among those in England); smaller employers (42% among employers with 2 to 4 employees compared to 32% among large establishments with 100 or more staff); and employers in Transport and Storage (43%) and Primary Sector and Utilities (41%).

### People and personal skills lacking among applicants

Turning to people and personal skills, 66% of skill-shortage vacancies were at least partially caused by a lack of people and personal skills. This represents a substantial drop from 2017 (75%). Technical and practical skill shortages were already more prevalent than people and personal skill shortages in 2017, and in 2019 this difference became more pronounced.

As was the case in previous waves of ESS, the most common people and personal skill lacking among applicants was the ability to manage one's own time and prioritise tasks - however the proportion of skill-shortage vacancies at least partially attributed to this has dropped since 2017 (from 50% to 45%). This represents a trend across most people and personal skills, which were generally less commonly cited as a reason for skill-shortage vacancies than in 2017.

When time management and task prioritisation skills are combined with the ability to manage one's own feelings and handle the feelings of others - which was cited as a skilled lacking for 33% of all skill-shortage vacancies - just over half (52%) of skill-shortage vacancies were at least partly caused by a lack of'self-management skills'. Asin 2017, a lack of self-management skills was particularly prevalent for employers in the Hotels and Restaurants sector (a factor for 65% of all skill-shortage vacancies in the sector).

Over two-fifths (44%) of skill-shortage vacancies were at least partially attributable to a lack of'management and leadership' skills, such as managing or motivating other staff, persuading and influencing others, and setting objectives and/or planning resources.

Again, in line with 2017, a lack of management and leadership skills was most prevalent for employers in the Hotels and Restaurants sector (54%).

Another group of people and personal skills that were commonly lacking were'sales and customer skills' - such as customer handling skills and sales skills - which were cited as a cause of just under four-in-ten (39%) skill-shortage vacancies. As was the case in 2017, a lack of such skills was particularly prevalent in the Arts and Other Services (55%) and Wholesale and Retail (50%) sectors. There was a sharp drop in the proportion of Financial Services skill-shortage vacancies attributable to a lack of these skills (from 71% to 39%).

**Figure 3-2 People and personal skills found difficult to obtain from applicants**

### Digital skills lacking among applicants

For the first time in 2019, employers that reported difficulties in finding applicants with adequate digital skills (30% of employers with SSVs) were asked about the specific IT skills they found difficult to obtain from applicants. Respondents with skill-shortage vacancies caused by a lack of IT skills most commonly found it difficult to find applicants with foundational digital skills such as using basic Microsoft Office applications (36% of IT-related skill-shortage vacancies were caused by these issues) or doing things such as turning on devices and typing (25% of IT-related skill-shortage vacancies were caused by these issues). Grouped, these basic skills contributed to half of digital skill-shortage vacancies (51%). More advanced IT skills did contribute collectively to a significant number of IT-related skills-shortage vacancies, although there was a wider spread of specific advanced IT skills that were contributing to these skills needs.

As Figure 3-3 demonstrates, a lack of more advanced IT skills was reported less commonly for each individual skill - for example, around an eighth (12%) of IT-related skill-shortage vacancies concerned advanced Microsoft Office skills or 'app' programming and development skills, and 7% related to a lack of data analysis, data analytics, or data science skills. These findings indicate that, insofar as a lack of IT skills was causing recruitment difficulties, it was generally a lack of fundamental skills which was most problematic, rather than a lack of more advanced skills.

Employers with 100-249 employees were no more likely to be affected by a lack of basic digital skills among applicants, but their IT skill-shortage vacancies were significantly more likely to be linked to more advanced IT skills such as 'app' programming and development (32% of IT-related skill-shortage vacancies among such employers were to do with 'app' programming and development, compared to 12% overall) and data analysis (13%, compared to 7% overall). This finding may warrant further research to understand why these employers experience greater challenges recruiting individuals with advanced IT skills. It may be for example that when employers reach this size, they are more likely to require such skills, but find themselves in competition with larger employers - who less frequently cited struggling to recruit candidates with advanced IT skills such as app development (12%) and data analysis (3%).

There were also some differences by sector. As might be expected, a lack of more advanced IT skills among applicants was more commonly reported as a problem by employers in the Information and Communications sector: over a quarter (26%) of IT-related skill-shortage vacancies in this sector related to 'app' programming and development skills (compared to 12% overall), and 15% related to building and maintaining IT systems (compared to 4% overall).

Certain sectors - potentially those where specialist sector- or business-specific IT systems are more prevalent - were more affected by a lack of specialist software, hardware or internal systems skills among applicants: for example 38% of IT-related skill-shortage vacancies in the Financial Services sector, and 35% of those in the Manufacturing sector, concerned specialist software, hardware or internal systems skills (compared with 20% overall).

While a lack of advanced IT skills among applicants was generally less frequent, employers were more likely to report a lack of advanced IT skills among applicants when recruiting for certain occupations. For example, nearly a quarter (24%) of IT-related skill-shortage vacancies in Professional occupations were related to 'app' programming and development skills, and over a quarter (26%) of IT-related skill-shortage vacancies in Administrative and Clerical occupations were related to advanced Microsoft Office skills (see Figure 3-4). At the same time, it is not simply service- or labour-intensive occupations which are affected by a lack of basic IT skills among applicants: nearly half (46%) of IT-related skill-shortage vacancies in Managerial occupations concerned basic Microsoft Office skills.

Figure 3-4 shows each occupation and the two most common digital skills (grouped as defined by the key in the figure) that contributed to IT-related skill-shortage vacancies among these occupations. The proportion of skill-shortage vacancies to which digital skills issues contributed overall is also provided to give a sense of the importance of digital skills for each occupation.

In summary, where recruitment difficulties are being caused by a lack of IT skills amongst applicants, more basic IT skills such as basic Microsoft office skills or foundation digital skills were the most common contributor to IT-related skill-shortage vacancies, although a lack of advanced IT skills also contributed to the picture.

### Types of skills lacking among applicants by sector

As discussed in the second chapter of this report, the four sectors with the highest density of skill-shortage vacancies were Construction, Manufacturing, Primary Sector and Utilities, and Business Services, with the Manufacturing sector registering a particularly notable increase in skill-shortage vacancy density since 2017. The broad skills characteristics lacking among applicants for these sectors, relative to the average across all occupations, is illustrated in Figure 3-5. The skills groupings used throughout this section are detailed in Table B.1, Table B.2 and Table B.3 in Appendix B

In the Construction sector, skills relating to complex analytical skills and self-management were disproportionately likely to be lacking among applicants (54% and 61%, respectively, compared to respective figures of 45% and 52% overall).

Despite the high skill-shortage vacancy density in the manufacturing sector, as shown in Figure 3-5, each broad skill grouping utilised was less likely to contribute to skill-shortage vacancies than among the average employer, with the exception of operational skills (45% for both Manufacturing employers and all establishments). Looking at specific skills lacking amongst applicants, employers in the Manufacturing sector were substantially more likely to cite a lack of skills to do with adapting to new equipment or materials among applicants (32% of skill-shortage vacancies in the Manufacturing sector were linked to this, compared with 21% overall), which could be a reflection of the introduction of new technologies in the sector. It is also worth noting that employers in this sector were more likely to mention issues with communicating in a foreign language among applicants (26%, compared with 17% overall), which may be linked to the integration of Manufacturing companies into international supply chains. For more detailed information about the specific skills lacking amongst applicants in the Manufacturing sector, please see Table A.3.3, Table A.3.4 and Table A.3.5 in Appendix A.

For Primary Sector and Utilities employers, as shown in Figure 3-5, skills that were most prominently lacking among applicants included those grouped as complex analytical skills (56% compared to 45% among all establishments) and self-management skills (58% compared to 52% among all establishments). When considering skills at a more specific level than those shown in Figure 3-5 (which are shown in Table A.3.3, Table A.3.4 and Table A.3.5 in Appendix A), the areas of skill shortages become more clear again: in particular, employers linked skill-shortage vacancies to applicants lacking specialist skills or knowledge needed to perform specific roles (75%, compared with 63% overall). Employers in this sector were also substantially more likely than average to link skill-shortage vacancies to a lack of people and personal skills among applicants (74%, compared with 66% overall), again indicating a broad-based issue with a lack of skills among applicants in this sector.

A lack of complex analytical skills was a key contributor to skill-shortage vacancies in the Business Services sector (51% of skill-shortage vacancies in this sector were at least partly attributable to a lack of complex analytical skills). Skill-shortage vacancies in this sector were also more likely than average to be linked to skills relating to management and leadership (49%, compared with 44% overall).

**Figure 3-5 Types of skills lacking across sectors with the highest density of skill-shortage vacancies (SSVs)**

**Figure 3-5 Types of skills lacking across sectors with the highest density of skill-shortage vacancies (SSVs)**

### The types of skills lacking among applicants by occupation

The four occupations in which employers experienced the most significant challenges in recruiting sufficiently skilled labour were Skilled Trades, Professionals, Machine Operatives, and Caring, Leisure and Other Services. The broad skills characteristics lacking among applicants for these occupations, relative to the average across all occupations, is illustrated in Figure 3-6. The skills groupings used throughout this section are detailed in Table B.1, Table B.2 and Table B.3 in Appendix B

For Skilled Trades, the category with by far the highest density of skill-shortage vacancies, the types of skills lacking broadly demonstrated a similar pattern to the overall average when looking at the broad groupings of skills, albeit with less of an emphasis on digital skills and sales and customer service skills. Looking outside the skills groupings shown in Figure 3-6, applicants to Skills Trades positions were disproportionately reported to be lacking skills such as specialist skills or knowledge needed to perform the role (a lack of such skills contributed to 72% of skill-shortage vacancies in Skilled Trades roles, compared with 63% across all skill-shortage vacancies), and manual dexterity (36%, compared with 18% overall). For more detailed information about the specific skills lacking in Skilled Trades occupations, please see Table A.3.6, Table A.3.7 and Table A.3.8 Appendix A.

Across the three other occupational categories, a similar pattern is demonstrated, with applicants less likely than average to lack skills in the broad skill categorisations. The one exception to this is applicants to Caring, Leisure and Other Service roles, where applicants were disproportionately likely to lack sales and customer service skills (a lack of such skills contributed to 49% of skill-shortage vacancies in Caring, Leisure and Other Service roles, compared with 39% across all skill-shortage vacancies) and self-management skills (64%, compared with 52% overall).

Table A.3.2 to Table A.3.8 in Appendix A provide a full breakdown of the skills lacking in the available labour market, by country, occupation and sector.

Figure 3-6 Types of skills lacking across occupations with the highest density of skill-shortage vacancies (SSVs).

## Skills lacking internally

This section examines the specific skills that employers felt were lacking among their workforce. Employers with skills gaps were asked, for up to a maximum of two occupations in which they reported skills gaps, which skills were lacking. The specific skills that were put to employers as potential causes of a lack of proficiency in the workforce were the same as those utilised in the previous analysis of skills lacking among applicants, which were outlined in the introduction to this chapter: technical and practical skills, people and personal skills and digital skills.

### Technical and practical skills lacking internally

At an overall level, it was generally the case that each technical and practical skill listed in Figure 3-7 contributed to a greater proportion of skills gaps than they had in 2017.

A deficiency in specialist skills or knowledge required to perform the job role was a contributing factor to around half of all skills gaps (53%), rising to around seven in ten within the Financial Services and Manufacturing sectors (73% and 65% respectively).

**Figure 3-7 Technical and practical skills lacking among staff with skills gaps**

As in 2017, a lack of knowledge of a company's products, services and internal processes was also a common cause of skills gaps (43%, compared to 39% in 2017). Aneed to improve such operational skills21 contributed to more than half of all skills gaps (53%, rising to 67% in the Financial Services sector). Operational skills contributed to a greater proportion of skills gaps in 2019 (53%) than in 2017 (48%).

Footnote 21: Operational skills were defined as knowledge of products and services offered and knowledge of how your organisation works.

A lack of proficiency in complex analytical skills contributed to just under half (47%) of all skills gaps, a slight increase from 2017 (43%), though this skills gap was more common among establishments in the Information and Communications (62%), Financial Services (57%), and Health & Social Work (56%) sectors.22

Footnote 22: Complex analytical skills included specialist skills or knowledge needed to perform the role and solving complex problems requiring a solution specific to the situation.

Around two-fifths of skills gaps (38%) involved a deficiency in digital skills, which includes both basic computer literacy and IT skills (28%) as well as more advanced or specialist IT skills (20%). The proportion of skills gaps that can be at least partly attributed to a lack of proficiency in digital skills was higher than in 2017 (35%).

Table A.3.9 to Table A.3.16 in Appendix A present the technical and practical skills lacking in the workforce by occupation, nation and sector.

### People and soft skills lacking internally

The most common people and soft skills that were identified as causing skills gaps in 2019 were broadly in line with findings in 2017, with the most common such skill lacking relating to an inability to manage their own time or prioritise their own tasks (60%). This cause of skills gaps, alongside the ability to manage one's own feelings and handle the feelings of others, which contributed to half of all skills gaps (49%), means that approaching three-quarters of skills gaps were at least partially caused by a lack of what can broadly be categorised as'self-management skills' (72%). A lack of self-management skills was a contributing factor to a higher proportion of skills gaps in the Health & Social Work sector (80%).

## Figure 3-8 People and soft skills lacking among staff with skills gaps

A lack of management and leadership skills contributed to around six in every ten skills gaps (57%), though to a higher proportion of gaps in Information and Communications (75%) and Health and Social Work (69%). As in 2017, sales and customer service skills were lacking for around half of all staff with skills gaps (50%).

### IT skills lacking internally

For the 2019 iteration of ESS, employers that identified skills gaps in their workforce related to IT skills were asked which specific IT skills were causing skills gaps in their workforce (8% of all employers and 38% of all employers with skills gaps). The most common IT related skill that needed improving in this group was basic Microsoft Office skills, which was a factor in a third of IT-related skills gaps (35%). Other commonly expressed IT related skills that needed improving included specialist software or hardware and internal systems (26%), foundational digital skills (19%) as well as advanced Microsoft Office skills (18%). Skills that were considered to be basic digital skills (which included foundation digital skills and basic Microsoft Office skills) were a factor in almost half (46%) of IT-related skills gaps. A list of the specific IT skills that were factors in IT skills gaps can be found in Figure 3-9.

When considering this by sector, foundation digital skills were a factor in a higher proportion of IT-related skills gaps within the Hotels & Restaurants (28%) and Wholesale & Retail sectors (28%). Issues relating to specialist software or hardware and internal systems contributed towards skills gaps in around three-fifths of IT skills gaps in the Public Administration (60%) and two-fifths for the Health and Social Work (43%) sectors, both levels far above the average.

**Figure 3-9 IT skills lacking among staff with skills gaps among establishments with skills gaps caused by a lack of IT skills**

### Profile of skills lacking in high skills gap density sectors

Figure 3-10 demonstrates the profile of skills contributing to skills gaps at the overall level as well as in the three sectors with the highest skill gap densities. As demonstrated, the overall profile of skills lacking in the workforce was relatively similar to the overall profile in 2017, although there has been a slight increase in complex and analytical skills gaps in 2019. The skills groupings used throughout this section are detailed in Table B.1, Table B.2 and Table B.3 in Appendix B

Within the Hotels and Restaurants sector, a far higher proportion of skills gaps were related to sales and customer skills (71%) and a slightly higher proportion were causedby management and leadership (62%) than the average (50% and 57% respectively). Skills gaps in this sector were far less likely to have been caused by digital skills (21%) compared to the overall picture (38%), however.

In the Manufacturing sector, a greater proportion of skills gaps were caused by complex and analytical (54%) and operational related skills (57%) compared to the average (47% and 53% respectively), but far fewer skills gaps were caused by sales and customer related skills (17%) than the average (50%).

The Public administration sector had a higher than average skills gap density but the skills lacking in this sector were spread out more widely and more thinly between each skill Indeed, fewer skills gaps were caused by the areas shown in Figure 3-10, except for digital skills, this being a result of each person lacking proficiency being described as having fewer skills gaps. One specific skill where skills deficiencies contributed to a higher proportion of skills gaps than average (although not shown in Figure 3-10), was adapting to new equipment or materials (47% compared to 36%), as shown in Table A.3.10 in Appendix A.

**Figure 3-10 Skills lacking in sectors with highest density of skills gaps**

### Profile of skills lacking in high skills gap density occupations

The profile of the skills lacking among the three occupational groups with the highest densities of skills gaps (Elementary, Sales and customer Services, and Machine Operatives) is shown in Figure 3-11.

The profile of skills lacking within occupations classified as Elementary Staff was broadly similar to the profile of skills lacking overall, although a notably lower proportion of skills gaps related to Complex analytical skills (39%) and Digital skills (25%) than the overall profile (47% and 38% respectively).

Predictably, deficiencies in sales and customer skills contributed to the greatest proportion of skills gaps among employees in Sales and customer service occupations (75%), at a rate far above the overall picture (50%). Self-management also contributed to a large proportion of skills gaps for these occupations (75%), albeit this was more in line with the overall average (72%).

Despite occupations classified as being Machine Operatives having a higher than average skills gap density, these skills gaps were less consistently identified as being caused by the factors displayed in Figure 3-11 than among all occupations overall, perhaps unsurprisingly most notably regarding sales and customer skills (24% compared to 50% overall).

Employees in high-skill occupations (Managers, Professionals and Associate Professionals) were more likely than average to be deficient in management and leadership skills (72% when grouped compared with 57% overall). Complex-analytical skills were more commonly identified as areas needing improvement among high-skill and middle-skill occupations (57% and 53% respectively) than the overall average (47%). Operational skills contributed to the highest proportion of skills gaps among staff in Service-intensive professions (60% compared to the overall average of 53%).

**Figure 3-11 Skills lacking in occupations with highest density of skills gaps**

## 4 Addressing skills shortages

### Chapter summary

The most common cause of skills gaps remained factors that can be considered transient namely because individuals were new to the role or because their training was only partially completed (79%), although only in a minority of cases were skills gaps caused exclusively by transient factors (20%). Other key causes included steps taken to positively transform a business creating skills gaps (42%) and staff lacking motivation (38%).

The most common actions taken to overcome skill-shortage vacancies were increasing advertising or recruitment spend (37%) or using new recruitment methods or channels (37%). In comparison, establishments tried to overcome skills gaps in their workforce most often by increasing training activity (64%) and by increased supervision of staff (55%). Perhaps unsurprisingly, employers tried to rectify skill-shortage vacancies most often through looking externally, to their recruitment methods, while they tried to address skills gaps by looking to their internal processes such as training and their management of staff.

When considering the factors that employers looked for when recruiting (such as qualifications and work experience) those with skill-shortage vacancies tended to place greater importance on each potential factor than those that did not have skill-shortage vacancies. This was particularly true regarding relevant work experience (17 percentage point difference), vocational qualifications (12 percentage point difference) and having a degree or degree-equivalent qualification (8 percentage point difference).

Similarly, in terms of recruitment methods and strategies used to fill vacancies, employers with skill-shortage vacancies were more likely to have used each recruitment method in order to fill vacancies than employers that had vacancies, none of which were classified as hard to fill due to skill-shortages. This was also the case for employers with skills gaps compared to those without them, although the association was less strong.

In much the same way, it was generally the case that employers with skills needs were more likely to have engaged with national skills policy initiatives than those without skills needs, including taking on apprentices, trainees or expressing interest in offering work placements through the T-Levels scheme.

## Introduction

This chapter first considers the causes of skills gaps within the workforce, in order to provide context about the steps taken by employers to address skills shortages, both among their current staff and among prospective applicants to vacancies. The chapter also covers recruitment, particularly considering whether the recruitment methods and strategies used by employers and the profile of skills and qualifications that employers look for among applicants vary based upon whether an employer has current skills deficiencies. Finally, the rate at which employers are engaging with national skills policy initiatives is also considered, again split out by employers with skills needs and those without them.

### Causes of skills gaps

The most common causes of skills gaps among the existing workforce were that individuals were new to the role which was a contributing factor to two-thirds of skills gaps (67%) or that their training was only partially completed (61%). These may be classified as transient skills gaps as they are factors which would be expected to ease naturally over time: they contributed to four in five skills gaps (79%), although were the exclusive cause in one in five cases (20%). These transient factors contributed to slightly more skills gaps than in 2017 (76%), although were the exclusive cause of slightly fewer (21%). Other common causes of skills gaps included staff lacking motivation (38%), the fact that staff had been on training but their performance had not improved sufficiently (33%) and employers being unable to recruit staff with the required skills (32%). The causes of skills gaps are presented in Figure 4-1.

The profile of these causes of skills gaps, in terms of the ranking of causes from most common to least common, was broadly similar in 2019 to the profile in 2017 and 2015. However, all causes of skills gaps were mentioned by more employers in 2019 than in 2017 and 2015. The most marked increases compared to 2017 were regarding problems retaining staff (an increase of 7 percentage points) and the introduction of new technology causing gaps (an increase of 6 percentage points), with most causes having increased by around four or five percentage points.

## Figure 4-1 Main causes of skills gaps (prompted)

A greater proportion of skills gaps were caused exclusively by transient factors in in Northern Ireland (25% compared with 20% in England and Wales) and among establishments in the Construction (29%), Arts & Other Services (26%) and Public Administration (25%) sectors. A smaller proportion of skills gaps were caused entirely by transient factors in the Transport and Storage sector, with only one in seven skills gaps (14%) caused entirely by employees being new to the role or their training being incomplete.

Another common cause of skills gaps was staff lacking motivation, a factor in around two-fifths of skills gaps (38%), rising to half of skill gaps among Elementary Staff (51%).

Issues related to training were also a prominent cause of skills gaps. Staff having received training but their performance not sufficiently improving was a factor in a third of all skills gaps (33%), while over a quarter of all skills gaps were caused at least in part because staff had not received the appropriate training (28%). In both cases, skills gaps within the Primary Sector and Utilities sector were more likely to be caused in part by these training related issues (42% and 33% respectively).

Around a third (32%) of skills gaps were caused at least in part by an inability to recruit staff with the required skills, an increase on the proportion in 2017 (28%). There was no clear correlation between sectors with particularly high densities of skill-shortage vacancies and sectors in which a high proportion of skills gaps were caused to some extent by an inability to recruit staff with the required skills.

There are some workplace activities such as introducing new technology or working practices which, although a cause of skills gaps in the short-term, represent a positive tendency in that it indicates employer investment in future growth. In 2019 42% of skills gaps were caused by these sorts of factors, a significant increase compared with 34% in 2017. The introduction of new working practices contributed to 29% of skills gaps (an increase from 24% in 2017). Similarly, the proportion of skills gaps caused by the introduction of new technology (25%, up from 19%), and the proportion of skills gaps caused by the development of new products and services (20%, up from 16%) have also increased between 2017 and 2019. The introduction of new technology was a more common contributing cause of skills gaps in Wales (30%) than in England (25%), and in both nations this was more common than in Northern Ireland (13%).

These increases in potentially 'positive' causes of skills gaps, when combined with the increase in number of transient skills gaps, may somewhat offset concerns about the rise in number of skills gaps overall. However, it is important to note that there was no difference in terms of the proportion of skills gaps that can be said to be exclusively caused by positive transformational factors (0.4% in 2019 and 0.6% in 2017), while a slightly smaller proportion of factors were exclusively transient in nature (20%, down from 21% in 2017). When combining these factors, the proportion of skills gaps that were caused exclusively by positive factors or transient factors had remained the same (21% in 2017 and 2019). Consequently, it does not appear that the increase in skills gaps between 2017 and 2019 can be understood exclusively as resulting from potentially positive causes that may indicate investment in future growth.

Table A.4.1 and Table A.4.2 in Appendix A provide breakdowns of the most common causes of skills gaps by sector and occupation. Table B.4 in Appendix B provides the definitions of the two groupings of causes of skills gaps (transient and positive transformational) that have been used for analysis in this section of the report.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:64]

More than a third of employers with skill-shortage vacancies had recruited, or tried to recruit, workers who were non-UK nationals in order to fill vacancies (37%). This was most often either EU nationals (17%) or both EU and non-EU nationals (17%), and rarely exclusively non-EU nationals (2%).

Employers in Northern Ireland (41%) and England (38%) were more likely to have pursued recruitment of non-UK nationals to address skill-shortage vacancies than those in Wales (25%).

The recruitment, or attempted recruitment, of non-UK employees was less commonly utilised to try to address skills gaps among existing workers than it was to address skill-shortage vacancies. Employers with skills gaps in their workforce were asked whether they had recruited, or tried to recruit, non-UK national workers in order to overcome these skills gaps - 13% of these establishments had done so. This most commonly involved both EU nationals and non-EU nationals (7%), although just under 1 in 20 establishments had specifically targeted EU nationals only (4%), while 1% had targeted non-EU nationals only.

Employers in Northern Ireland were more likely to have recruited or tried to recruit non-UK nationals in order to overcome skills gaps (16%) than those in England (13%) or particularly Wales (7%).

## What employers with skill-shortage vacancies look for when recruiting?

When considering the factors that employers looked for in recruits, the factor that was most commonly identified by establishments as being of significant or critical importance was relevant work experience (63%). This was followed by Maths & English GCSE A* - C (52%), vocational qualifications (47%), academic qualifications (42%) and finally a degree or degree equivalent qualification (20%).

Breaking this profile down by establishments that have skill-shortage vacancies and those that do not, there was a clear pattern of employers with skill-shortage vacancies placing greater importance on each factor than those that did not have them. This was particularly true regarding relevant work experience (17 percentage point difference), vocational qualifications (12 percentage point difference) and having a degree or degree-equivalent qualification (8 percentage point difference).

Figure 4-3 below demonstrates the importance that employers placed upon each factor that employers looked for in recruits, split out by employers with skill-shortage vacancies and those without them, highlighting this pattern of employers with skill-shortages placing greater importance on each factor.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:66]

In much the same way, employers who have had vacancies in the last 12 months that had skills gaps were also more likely to have utilised each recruitment method than employers with vacancies that did not have skills gaps. The profile of usage of these recruitment methods is presented in Figure 4-4, broken down by employers with a fully proficient workforce and those with skills gaps.

Out of the three employer profiles demonstrated in Figure 4-4, employers with skill-shortage vacancies were the most likely to have used each of the recruitment methods over the last 12 months. Establishments with skill-shortage vacancies were the least likely to have utilised exclusively one approach (7%) or word of mouth only (4%), when compared to employers with vacancies, none of which were classified as skill-shortage vacancies (word of mouth only: 16%; single approach only 30%). It is clear, therefore, that are employers with skill-shortage vacancies used more varied recruitment strategies.

**Figure 4-4 Recruitment methods used in the last 12 months**

### Do employers with skills needs engage with skills policy initiatives?

At an overall level, engagement with skills policy initiatives was relatively low, with 10% of employers having any staff undertaking a formal apprenticeship, 3% of employers having had anyone undertake a Traineeship over the last 12 months and 19% of Welsh and Northern Irish establishments having used National Occupational Standards in some way. Just over a third of English establishments also registered some interest in providing work placements to T-Level students at some point in the future (36%).

In general, employers with skills needs were more likely to have engaged with each of these skills policy initiatives than employers without skills needs. Employers with skill-shortage vacancies were more likely to have employed somebody undertaking a formal apprenticeship (25%) than those without a skill-shortage vacancy (10%). Employers with skill-shortage vacancies were also more likely to state that they planned to offer apprenticeships in the future (59% compared to 29% without) and that they expected their apprentice numbers to increase (46% compared to 27% without). Similarly, employers with skills gaps were more likely to have at least one member of staff undertaking a formal apprenticeship (28% compared to 8% without) and they were also more likely to expect to offer an apprenticeship (51% compared to 27% without). This extended to the number of apprentices that establishments with skills needs had too, with those with skill-shortage vacancies having more than twice as many apprentices on average (4.9) than those without them (2.3); although it was still higher among those with skills gaps (3.1) than without (2.4), the association was less strong than when considering establishments by skill-shortage vacancy status. Employers with skill-shortage vacancies (46%) were more likely to expect the number of apprentices at the site to increased than those without skill-shortage vacancies (27%), although there was, however, no difference in this regard based upon whether they had skills gaps (32%) or not (29%).

Employers with skill-shortage vacancies were also more likely to have had anyone undertake a Traineeship over the last 12 months (5% compared to 2% without a skill-shortage vacancy). Usage of National Occupational Standards in Northern Ireland and Wales was also higher among employers with at least one skill-shortage vacancy (26%) than those without (19%). Interest in potentially offering work experience placements through T-Levels was also higher, with around two thirds of employers with a skill-shortage vacancy (64%) expressing interest in doing so, compared to around a third without a skill-shortage vacancy (35%).

Employers with skills gaps were also more likely to have engaged with skills policy initiatives than those without skills gaps. This included having undertaken a Traineeship (4% compared to 2% without) and expressing interest in offering work placements through the T-Levels scheme (54% compared to 33% without). There was, however, nodifference between employers with skills gaps (20%) and those without skills gaps (19%) regarding usage of National Occupation Standards.

These findings present a perhaps reassuring picture, in that employers with skills needs are turning to skills policy initiatives, potentially in an attempt to resolve these issues. Similarly, from a T-Levels policy perspective this presents something of a readymade market for T-Levels placements, with employers with skill-shortage vacancies (64%) and skills gaps (54%) expressing an interest in offering work placements through this scheme. These findings represent new analysis for the ESS series (utilising a combination of both ESS and EPS measures) and represent interesting results, although in some respects interpretation is difficult. This could represent an area for further research in the future, in order to provide better understand the relationship between employer skills needs and engagement with the skills system.

## 5 Future skills requirements

### Chapter summary

A majority of employers anticipated the need to develop the skills of any of their workforce in the coming year (64%), particularly large employers with 250 or more employees (89%) and establishments in the Public Administration sector (80%). It was most common for employers to anticipate the need to upskill their employees at the managerial level.

The most common reasons for their expected need to upskill their staff were in response to new legislative or regulatory requirements (42%), because of the introduction of new technologies or equipment (41%), the development of new products and services (35%) and the introduction of new working practices (35%). The profile reasons for anticipating upskilling requirements remained relatively similar between 2017 and 2019.

The most common skills that were identified by employers as requiring development were specialist skills and knowledge (50%), knowledge of products and services offered (48%) and the ability to adapt to new equipment or materials (45%). Technical and practical skills, therefore, played a more prominent role in the upskilling picture than they had in the skills that were lacking among the current workforce and among applicants. Digital skills were also more prominently a part of employer anticipation of upskilling requirements (47%), perhaps reflecting the pace of change of digital skills requirements. Conversely, while people and personal skills such as staff being able to manage their own time and prioritise tasks (41%) were still important factors that were identified by establishments as requiring development over the coming 12 months, they were less significant than in the current skills need picture.

### Introduction

Employers were asked in ESS 2019 about their anticipated requirement to upskill, or develop, their current workforce in the next 12 months (from the time of the survey). It should be noted that employers were asked about these future needs prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. This chapter considers how prevalent it was for employers to anticipate the need to upskill their workforce and which occupations this was most common among, as well as the reasons provided by employers for needing to develop the skills of their workforce. This chapter also contains analysis of the specific skills that employers identified as needing development among their employees, as well as analysis about the factors that are most significant drivers of the need for employers to upskill their workforce.

## The prevalence of the need to upskill

Around two-thirds of all establishments expected that they would need to upskill their workforce in the next 12 months (64%), which represents a slight increase from 2017 (62%). This was most common in Wales (68%, up from 63% in 2017) compared to England (64%) and Northern Ireland (63%). There was a link between business size and likelihood to want to upskill the workforce in the next 12 months, with around nine in ten employers with 250 or more employees expecting to have to upskill in the next 12 months (89%), compared with three-fifths of those with 2 to 4 employees (59%). For a full breakdown of expected need to upskill the workforce by size and country, see Figure 5-1.

In terms of sector, employers classified as Public Administration were the most likely to express an anticipated need to upskill their workforce (80%), followed by those classified as Financial Services (74%), Information and Communications (73%), Education (73%), Health and Social Work (73%) and Business Services (70%). Establishments classified as Hotels & Restaurants (55%) and Construction (56%) were the least likely to anticipate a need to upskill in the next 12 months. Figure 5-1 shows the full profile of the expected requirements to upskill by sector.

## Upskilling: skills that need improving

Those employers that identified an occupation most affected by the need for upskilling were asked which skills would require developing over the coming 12 months among their staff. Again, these have been grouped into three categories:

The individual skills within these broader groupings are also grouped into smaller, more thematic groupings, as defined in Table B.1, Table B.2 and Table B.3 in Appendix B

### Technical and practical skills that required upskilling

The most common technical and practical skills that establishments stated that they anticipated needing to develop in the coming 12 months were specialist skills or knowledge that were required in that role, with half of establishments with an upskilling need stating that this would need to be developed (50%). This figure rose to just under two-thirds of establishments in the Public Administration (63%) and Financial Services (62%) sectors. There was also a strong link between establishment size and the anticipated need to upskill specialist skills or knowledge, with establishments with 100 or more employees being more likely to anticipate the need to develop these skills (66%) than smaller employers (2 to 4 employees 44%, 5 to 24 employees 53%, 25 to 49 employees 58%, 50 to 99 employees 61%).

Employers were also likely to anticipate the need to develop knowledge of products and services (48%) and adapting to new equipment or materials (45%) in the coming 12 months. The need to upskill staff relating to knowledge of products and services was particular common in the Financial Services sector (67%), while the need to adapt to new equipment or materials was most keenly felt as an upskilling requirement among Primary Sector and Utilities (57%) and Manufacturing (57%) establishments.

When grouping these skills by area; over half (52%) cited operational skills such as knowledge of how the organisation works, around half (47%) cited digital skills (at advanced and/or basic level), over two-fifths (44%) mentioned complex analytical skillssuch as complex numerical or statistical skills and 36% mentioned basic skills such as basic digital and basic numerical skills. This profile was broadly similar to the profile of skills that had been identified as lacking in the current workforce (see Overall picture - skill-shortage vacancies and skills gaps), although digital skills are more commonly seen as skills that may require development in the coming 12 months (47%) than they are seen as skills that the workforce is currently lacking proficiency in (38%), perhaps reflecting the rapid pace at which digital skill requirements can change.

**Figure 5-4 Technical and practical skills that employers expect to need to develop in the coming 12 months**

### People and personal skills that required upskilling

The profile of people and personal skills that employers identified as being in need of development over the coming 12 months was consistent in 2019 and 2017, albeit with a reduction across the board, with each skill being slightly less commonly cited than in 2017. Skills relating to self-management (49%) and management and leadership (48%) were the most commonly identified people and personal skills that establishments felt they would need to develop among their workforce.

It was generally the case that there was a correlation between employer size and the likelihood for an establishment to identify each skill shown in Figure 5-5. The most marked difference in this regard was found regarding the need to increase the ability of staff to manage their own feelings or handle the feelings of others; there was a 26 percentage point gap between employers with 2 to 4 employees (26%) and those with 100 or more employees (52%) in relation to the need to develop this skill.

A full profile of the people and personal skills identified by employers as in need of development in the coming 12 months, broken down by size and sector, can be found in Table A.5.6 and Table A.5.7 in Appendix A.

**Figure 5-5 People and personal skills that employers expect to need to develop in the coming 12 months**

**Base: 2019:** All establishments anticipating a need for new skills in next 12 months (and could identify an occupation that would be most affected) (Modules B and D) (19.50): 2017:** All establishments who anticipate a need for new skills in next 12 months (and could identify an occupation that would be most affected) (24.34)

**Digital skills that require upskilling**

In the 2019 iteration of ESS, 47% of employers that identified a requirement to upskill their workforce the digital skills of their employees in the coming 12 months. For the first time in 2019, employers were asked a follow up question to identify the specific digital skills that required development. By far the most commonly identified skill requiring development related to using new or updated company software or systems, required among 39% of employers with digital upskilling requirements.

There was some variation in terms of digital skills that establishments identified as requiring upskilling. It was more common for larger establishments to identify a need to develop foundation digital skills (14% of employers with digital upskilling needs with 100 or more employees) than smaller employers (9% of employers with digital upskilling needs with fewer than 100 employees). Contrastingly, among establishments with requirements to develop digital skills, smaller establishments, especially those with 2 to 4 employees, were more likely to identify a need to develop graphic design or design engineering skills (7%) than those with 5 or more employees (4%).

There was also sectoral variation regarding digital skills that employers felt needed developing in the coming 12 months. Establishments in the Financial Services sector (47%) were most likely to require development regarding skills using new or updated company systems, particularly when compared to those in Manufacturing (36%), Construction (35%), Primary Sector and Utilities (30%) and Hotels and Restaurants (30%). Employers classified as Public Administration were most likely to require development in advanced Microsoft Office skills (21%). Graphic design and design engineering skills were most commonly identified as being in need of development among establishments in the Manufacturing (12%), Construction (11%) and Business Services (10%) sectors.

For a full list of digital skills identified as requiring development, broken down by country, size and sector, please see Table A.5.8 and Table A.5.9 in Appendix A.

## 6 Conclusions

Fieldwork for the Employer Skills Survey (ESS) 2019 took place at a time of economic growth of the UK economy: ONS data shows that at the second quarter of 2019, when ESS 2019 fieldwork began, job creation was at its highest level since records began (an employment rate of 76.1%).25 Despite this, UK productivity was behind most other G7 countries and in the second quarter of 2019 output per hour fell by 0.5%, the largest quarterly fall in productivity in five years.26 Developing the skills and proficiency of the workforce is seen as a key route through which these productivity issues may be addressed.

Footnote 26: ONS. Labour productivity, UK: April to June 2019, (2019)

Despite an overall fall compared to 2017 in the proportion of employers that had vacancies, the volume of vacancies that were hard to fill for skills-related reasons and the proportion of all vacancies where skill shortages were encountered were slightly higher than in 2017. These skills challenges during recruitment have remained high in certain sectors, particularly Construction, and have become more acute in others (notably Manufacturing). In both, over a third of current vacancies were considered to be skill-shortage vacancies (i.e. hard to fill for skills-related reasons).

The proportion of the workforce that employers considered to have skills gaps had also risen since 2017, the first instance of an increase in the ESS series since 2011. These changes were driven by increases in such skills challenges in England. Skills gaps within the workforce affected some sectors more than others and remained most common in the Hotels and Restaurants and Manufacturing sectors. However, from 2017 to 2019, there was a large increase in the proportion of the workforce considered to have a skills gap in the Public Administration sector, and a large decrease in Financial Services.

The profile of the types of skills that were lacking among the labour market remained relatively consistent between 2017 and 2019, albeit with each skill generally contributing to a slightly smaller proportion of skill-shortage vacancies. The most common skill found lacking among applicants related to a lack of specialist skills or knowledge needed to perform the role. When considering the skills lacking among the existing workforce, the picture was also consistent with 2017, with self-management skills remaining the most prevalent. Unsurprisingly, there was wide variance in terms of the skills lacking among the prospective and current workforces when looking at different sectors and different occupations.

The most common steps taken by employers to address their skills needs were, for skill-shortage vacancies, to increase advertising or recruitment spend or to use new recruitment methods and channels, while to try to overcome skills gaps in the workforce, employers increased training activity and supervision of staff.

Skill requirements are fast changing, and while a minority (13%) of employers reported that there were skills gaps in their workforce, still a majority anticipated the need to upskill their workforce in the coming year. This was particularly true for larger employers. Reasons tended to be forwards looking, responding to new legislative or regulatory requirements, new technologies or equipment, or new products and services. The skills that were most commonly identified as requiring upskilling in the workforce closely relate to this; employers felt that they would need to upskill their staff regarding specialist skills and knowledge of products and services offered and the ability to adapt to new equipment or materials.

ESS provides a snapshot of the skills situation employers were facing in the second half of 2019. The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 has clearly provided a significant shock to the economy and is likely to have lasting and significant effects on employers and their skills needs. While this makes extrapolating ESS 2019 results to the post-Covid-19 situation problematic, the ESS 2019 results provide an important baseline to assess the post-Covid economy and labour market as we enter a new decade.

## Appendix C: Industry coding

Each establishment was allocated to one of 13 sectors, based on their Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). SIC 2007 was used to classify establishments using the following method. Using the four-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) supplied for each record from the Market Location or IDBR database, a description of business activity was read out to each respondent. If they agreed that this description matched the main activity undertaken at the establishment, then the SIC on Market Location's database or IDBR was assumed to be correct. If, however, the respondent felt the description did not correspond to their main business activity at the site (around a fifth of cases), a verbatim response was collected to find out what they do. At the analysis stage this was coded to a four-digit SIC which was then used as the basis for allocation into sector.

The table below shows the 13 sectors and their corresponding SIC 2007 definitions.27

## Appendix D: Occupational Coding

The occupational data collected in the survey were collected both pre-coded and verbatim. The former included the occupational breakdown of employment (question SD5A to SD8) where respondents were asked how many of their workforce fell into each of the nine major (one-digit) Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) 2010 categories (Managers, Directors and Senior Officials through to Elementary occupations). However, on vacancy measures (for example the occupations in which vacancies exist - question SC7) this information was collected verbatim. This was then coded at the analysis stage, where possible to a four-digit level SOC, if not three, two- or one-digit level.

Examples of what might fall into each occupational band are as follows:

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c} \hline \multirow{2}{*}{Occupational} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Primary sectors} & \multirow{2}{*}{Suride sectors (Ref.)} & \multirow{2}{*}{Public sector (Public)} \\  & (Primary Sector \&) & & \\ \hline group & Utilites, Manufacturing, & Finishers, Finance & Acmin, Health, \\  & Construction & Transport, etc) & Extraction, etc) \\ \hline \multirow{4}{*}{Managers, Directors and Senior Officials} & Site managers, & Directors, Managers / & Police inspectors and \\  & Department Heads, Shift & Branch/site managers, & above, department \\  & Managers (not & shift managers (not \\  & supervisors) & supervisors & heads, Head teachers, \\ \hline \multirow{4}{*}{Professionals} & Professional engineers, & Solicitors, lawyers, & \\  & software and IT & accountants, IT & Doctors, nurses, \\  & professionals, & professionals, & midwives, teachers, \\  & accountants, chemists, & economists, architects, & social workers, librarians \\  & scientific researchers & actuaries & \\ \hline \multirow{4}{*}{Associate Professionals} & Science and engineering & Insurance underwriters, & Junior police/fire/prison \\  & technicians, lab & finance/investment & officers, therapists, \\  & technicians, IT & analysts and advisers, & paramedics, community \\  & technicians, accounting & writers/journalists, & workers, HSS officers, \\  & technicians & buyers, estate agents & housing officers \\ \hline \multirow{4}{*}{Administrative staff} & Secretaries, & Secretaries, & Secretaries, \\  & receptionists, PAs, & receptionists, PAs, & receptionists, PAs, local \\  & telephonists, & communication & government officers and \\  & bookkeepers & operators, market & assistants, office \\  & bookkeepers & research interviewers, & assistants, library and \\  & & clerks & database assistants \\ \hline \multirow{4}{*}{Skilled Trades} & Farmers, electricians, & Motor mechanics, & \\  & machine setters / tool & printers, TV engineers, & Chefs \\  & makers, carpenters, & butchers & \\ \hline \multirow{4}{*}{Caring, Leisure and Other Service Occupations} & \multirow{2}{*}{Care assistants, nursery nurses} & Travel agents, travel & Care assistants, home \\  & & nurses & assistants, hairdressers, \\ \cline{1-1}  & Occupations & housekeepers & control, dental nurses, \\ \hline \multirow{4}{*}{Sales and customer service occupations} & Customer facing roles: & Sales assistants and & \\ \cline{1-1}  & sales staff and call centre & retail cashiers, telesales, & Customer care \\ \cline{1-1}  & agents & call centre agents & operations \\ \hline Process, plant and & Routine operatives, & HGV, van, fork-lift, bus & Drivers, vehicle \\ \cline{1-1}  & machine operatives & drivers, machine & and taxi drivers & inspectors \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Appendix E: Sampling error and statistical confidence

Sampling errors for the survey results overall and for key sub-groups are presented in Table E.1. Figures have been based on a survey result of 50% (the 'worst' case in terms of statistical reliability) and have used a 95% confidence level. Where the table indicates that a survey result based on all respondents has a sampling error of \(\pm 0.34\%\), this should be interpreted as follows: 'for a question asked of all respondents where the survey result is 50%, we are 95% confident that the true figure lies within the range 49.66% to 50.34%'. Significance testing on employer measures use the unweighted respondent base, while employment measures, and density measures such as the proportion of the workforce with skills gaps and skills-shortage vacancy density, have been calculated on the basis of the unweighted employment (or vacancy) base.

As a note, the calculation of sampling error has taken into account the finite population correction factor to account for cases where we are measuring a significant portion of the population universe (i.e. even if two sample sizes are the same, the sampling error will be lower if in one case a far higher proportion of the population was covered).

These confidence intervals are based on the assumptions of probability random sampling and a normal distribution of responses.
