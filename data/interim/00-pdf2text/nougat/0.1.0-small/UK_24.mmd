## 1 Overview

The UK government Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) commissioned Ipsos MORI and Perspective Economics to conduct research to improve their understanding of the current UK cyber security skills labour market. The research builds on comparable research which Ipsos MORI conducted for DCMS in 2018.1

This report provides the technical details for all strands of the research project, and copies of the main survey instruments (in the appendices) to aid with interpretation of the findings. DCMS has published a separate report of the main findings from the research.2

Footnote 2: See [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/c/cber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/c/cber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020).

### Full research objectives

The research aimed to gather evidence on:

* Current cyber security skills gaps (i.e. where existing employees or job applicants for cyber roles lack particular skills)
* Current skills shortages and the level and type of job roles they affect (i.e. a shortfall in the number of skilled individuals working in or applying for cyber roles)
* Where the cyber security jobs market is active geographically
* The roles being labelled as cyber roles versus ones that are not but require a similar skillset
* Diversity within the cyber sector
* The role of training, recruitment and outsourcing to fill skills gaps
* The types of cyber security training products and services available, and whether these are meeting industry needs
* Other nations' approaches to filling the cyber security skills gap

It also aims to create a set of recommendations on what the government and industry can do to tackle the cyber security skills gap.

### Summary of methodology

The methodology consisted of 6 strands. The role of the first 2 strands was mainly to feed into the development of the quantitative survey (strand 3) and qualitative research (strand 4), by scoping out the gaps in the existing literature and the topics that should be explored.

1. **Methodology and evidence review** - Professor Steven Furnell from the University of Plymouth carried out a rapid evidence review looking at the existing literature on cyber security skills gaps and shortages. The Ipsos MORI team and our academic partners on the study (see Acknowledgements section in this chapter) also reviewed the questionnaire from the 2018 research. We carried out this work across June and July 2019.
2. **Training provider market scoping - Ipsos MORI and Perspective Economics carried out in-depth interviews with cyber security training providers. Perspective Economics also carried out a review of all the UK training provider websites to give an overview of the market and help categorise the products and services being offered. This phase took place from June to August 2019.**3. **Quantitative surveys** - Ipsos MORI conducted representative telephone surveys with 4 audiences: general businesses, public sector organisations, charities and cyber sector firms. These surveys gathered the main estimates on skills gaps and shortages reported in this study. Fieldwork was between 7 August and 8 October 2019.
4. **Qualitative interviews** - Ipsos MORI conducted a more focused strand of qualitative research, with in-depth interviews split across large organisations and cyber sector firms. The interviews explored the challenges these organisations faced in addressing skills gaps and shortages, and the approaches they were taking on recruitment, training, outsourcing and workplace diversity. Interviews took place across September 2019.
5. **Job vacancies analysis** - Perspective Economics analysed cyber security job postings on the Burning Glass Technologies labour market database, showing the number, type and location of vacancies across the UK. This also covers remuneration, descriptions of job roles and the skills, qualifications and experience being sought by employers. This work covered vacancies over a period of 3 years, from September 2016 to the end of August 2019.
6. **Recommendations workshop** - Ipsos MORI carried out a workshop with key stakeholders from government, industry and academia to discuss the findings from the preceding strands and contribute to the project's recommendations. This took place in November 2019.

### Similarities and differences from the 2018 study

The 2018 study consisted of:

* A rapid evidence review of existing research on cyber skills and skills gaps
* Scoping interviews with industry experts, across trade associations, multinational businesses, cyber security specialists, training providers, recruitment agencies, academics and government
* Quantitative surveys with businesses, public sector organisations and charities
* Follow-up qualitative interviews with a mix of organisations that took part in the survey

The methodology for the quantitative surveys across both years is the same and the survey findings are intended to be comparable, where the same questions have been asked to the same groups.

However, there are various differences in the methodology this year:

* There were no scoping interviews this year. In 2018, these interviews mainly informed the questionnaire development and the definition of cyber security skills. Coming up with a definition was a specific objective of the 2018 study. This time, we already had a baseline questionnaire to adapt and there was no longer an objective to define cyber security skills
* Strands 2 (training provider market scoping), 5 (job vacancies analysis) and 6 (recommendations workshop) are entirely new for this year. These new strands allowed us to more effectively address the research objectives around training provision, recruitment and study recommendations
* In the quantitative survey, cyber sector firms were included as a sampled group for the first time this year. This was not possible in 2018 because there was no robust sample frame for these firms. This year's fieldwork came after DCMS's Cyber Sectoral Analysis 2020,3 which created a database of UK cyber sector firms. The findings from this sample form a baseline for future studies. We have also, in our main report, included findings from a separate, comparable survey of the same group (using the exact same sample frame and survey methodology) carried out as part of the Cyber Sectoral Analysis 2020. Fieldwork for this survey was carried out in summer 2019 In addition, in the quantitative survey, the sample size for charities is lower this year (201) than in 2018 (470). The margins of error for the charity findings this year are consequently higher. They were \(\pm\)4-6 percentage points (accounting for weighting) in 2018 and are \(\pm\)6-10 percentage points this year. The balance of the interviews this year reflected DCMS's priorities across all the sampled groups. It also made it feasible to include cyber sector firms this year within the total 1,558 quantitative survey interviews conducted
* The questionnaire for the quantitative surveys was revised with different routes for the general audience (businesses, public sector organisations and charities) and cyber sector firms. The main implications for the results were that, this year, the general audience surveys included new questions on job titles and descriptions, and only the cyber sector survey included questions on diversity, qualifications and recruitment. This followed the recommendations from the strand 1 methods review, which noted that questions on diversity, qualifications and recruitment were either answered by too few respondents or not understood well enough by the general business audience in 2018 to be useful
* The quantitative survey questionnaire was not cognitively tested again this year, having already been thoroughly tested in 2018
* The fieldwork for the quantitative survey shifted from summer in 2018 to autumn in this latest survey
* The qualitative strand focused on a different audience this year. In 2018, it followed up a range of organisations that took part in the quantitative survey, of all sizes and sectors. This year, we focused on large organisations and cyber sector firms, to better address objectives around recruitment, training, diversity and outsourcing. The small and medium-sized organisations we interviewed in 2018 typically had more basic skills needs, so could not discuss many of these more advanced skills issues. DCMS provided the sample of large organisations, including specific sectors with significant physical and digital infrastructure challenges such as finance, energy and transport organisations

### Differences from other well-known studies looking at cyber security skills

A note on the UK cyber security workforce size estimate from the 2019 Cybersecurity Workforce Study ISC2 is a global membership organisation for cyber security professionals. It publishes an annual Cybersecurity Workforce Study, the most recent of which was published in November 2019.4 This is a study of the global cyber security workforce and largely reports its findings at a global level.

Footnote 4: See [https://www.isc2.org/Research/2019-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Study#](https://www.isc2.org/Research/2019-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Study#). Before 2018, these were known as the Global Information Security Workforce Studies, or GISWS.

The 2019 ISC2 report includes one specific estimate for the UK, suggesting there are c.289,000 individuals in the UK cyber security workforce. It is not possible for us to validate their estimate with our data, given the vast differences in methodologies between our 2 studies (outlined later in this section) and a lack of published technical information on the UK sample size and representativeness of the ISC2 data. The estimate is also likely to have a substantive margin of error around it.

There are 2 sets of DCMS data that do provide an insight on the size of the UK cyber security workforce:

* DCMS's Cyber Sectoral Analysis 20203 estimates 42,855 full-time employees working in cyber roles in the UK cyber sector, across the 1,221 cyber security companies that make up this sector. This excludes individuals working in cyber roles outside of these companies Footnote 3: See [https://www.ev.com/en](https://www.ev.com/en). al/isss.
* In this cyber security skills research, we estimate that there were 393,257 unique job postings for cyber security roles in the past 3 years (see Chapter 6 of the main report). This suggests that the ISC2 figure of c289,000 may be an underestimate, although we cannot say this for sure. Not all of these job postings will have been filled, and some may be to replace individuals who have left the job (so would be double-counting people in the workforce)

Broader comparability issues between this DCMS study and other well-known studies on cyber security skills

The findings from the ISC2 2019 report touch on similar themes to our study (such as skills gaps, career pathways and qualifications) but they are not directly comparable. This is also the case for other well-known surveys that have been published since the previous DCMS cyber security skills study, including the EY Global Information Security Survey 2018-195 and the ISACA State of Cybersecurity 20196.

Footnote 6: See [https://www.isacac.org/info/state-of-cybersecurity-2019/index.html](https://www.isacac.org/info/state-of-cybersecurity-2019/index.html).

* Our primary research is UK-specific and has a large sample size. This means we can break down findings for UK organisations by size and sector. The aforementioned surveys have not been able to be so granular and have typically reported findings for Europe as a whole, rather than the UK
* Our survey results are sampled and weighted to be representative of organisations of all sizes and sectors. This includes micro and small businesses, and low-income charities, that may be less aware of their cyber security skills needs and make up the vast majority of all businesses and charities in the UK. The aforementioned surveys have been carried out online with a self-selecting sample, skewed towards the largest and most engaged organisations. These studies are important, as they have good coverage of the organisations with the most sophisticated cyber security skills needs. However, they are not necessarily representative, and typically omit micro, small and medium businesses, and the charitable sector, where there are often more basic cyber security skills needs
* the number of organisations lacking specific cyber security skills
- in a particular way. As we cannot objectively test whether organisations are capable of carrying out specific cyber security tasks involving specialist skills, we instead ask about their confidence at being able to carry out a range of these tasks (see Chapter 4 of the main report for full details). This continues the methodology we established in the 2018 study

## 2 Methodology and evidence review

This strand took place across June and July 2019. It had 3 parts:

1. Professor Steven Furnell of the University of Plymouth carried out a literature review of cyber skills and skills gaps. This was intended to update the same kind of review we undertook in the 2018 study, so focused mainly on new researched published since October 2018 (with occasional references to earlier studies that were not fully reviewed in 2018). Professor Furnell and the wider research team (Ipsos MORI, Perspective Economics, David Crozier, Professor Mark Button, Dr Victoria Wang and Professor Andrew Martin) compiled a longlist of 47 sources for inclusion. DCMS approved this list and flagged the priority documents for inclusion. The review focused mainly on 18 core documents, again approved by DCMS, with brief references to various other pieces. This removed documents that were less relevant or had unclear methodologies.
2. Professor Furnell also wrote up case studies of other nations' approaches to tackling cyber skills gaps, based on a further 20 documents gathered via the wider research team and DCMS. This focused on pulling out the key details of cyber security skills strategies and programmes in other countries.
3. Ipsos MORI carried out a review of the 2018 questionnaire, highlighting questions that filtered through to very small samples or received a high "don't know" response in the previous study. We also asked the academic partners to comment on the questionnaire and suggest new question areas and improvements. The changes to the questionnaire are covered in Chapter 4 rather than here.

All 3 parts informed the approach for the primary research - particularly the questionnaire development in the quantitative survey. Professor Furnell's output for parts 1 and 2 is reproduced in full in Appendix A.

## 3 Training provider market scoping

This strand took place between June and August 2019 and was led by Perspective Economics, with support from lpsos MORI. This was an entirely new strand of research, not conducted in 2018. The intentions were to:

* Better address the research objective around the types of training products and services available, and whether these are meeting industry needs
* Categorise training provision in a way that could be explored in strands 3 and 4

The primary research findings from this strand have been summarised in the main report.

### Training provider interviews

Perspective Economics and lpsos MORI conducted 7 in-depth interviews among cyber security training providers. These were all identified from the DCMS database of cyber sector firms built during the Cyber Sectoral Analysis 2020.7 Perspective Economics recruited these organisations via direct email and telephone contact. We included an incentive of E50 (either going to participants or to charity) to encourage participation.

Footnote 7: See [https://www.ov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-sectoral-analysis-2020](https://www.ov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-sectoral-analysis-2020).

The interviews explored:

* The types and areas of training currently offered
* The types and areas of training most in demand and the direction of travel for the next 2-5 years
* The kinds of clients demanding training and their awareness of their training needs
* The demand for and role of qualifications and certification in training
* The scalability of training
* Partnerships with industry and academic institutions
* Involvement in (and experience of) government-backed cyber security skills programmes

To help with the final area, recruitment focused on training providers involved in the Cyber Skills Immediate Impact Fund (CSIIF).8 In total, 6 of the 7 providers we interviewed were involved in the CSIIF.

Footnote 8: See [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-skills-immediate-impact-fund](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-skills-immediate-impact-fund).

The topic guide for this part is in Appendix B.

### Review of all UK training provider websites

This strand also included a secondary research component. Perspective Economics carried out systematic web scraping of UK training provider websites to establish what products and services they offer and give an overview of the market. We used the findings to create a categorisation of training products and services (reproduced in Appendix C). lpsos MORI cross-referenced this categorisation against the quantitative survey questionnaire to ensure we collected the right information.

## 4 Quantitative surveys

Ipsos MORI carried out all aspects of the quantitative surveys. This chapter provides technical details on the questionnaire development, sampling, piloting, main fieldwork and data processing.

### Questionnaire development

Ipsos MORI developed the questionnaire and all the other survey instruments (such as the interviewer briefing notes, a reassurance email for respondents and a survey website page). The starting point for this work was the 2018 questionnaire.

The strand 1 questionnaire review and strand 2 training provider scoping informed the changes made to this year's questionnaire. The DCMS team and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) also reviewed the questionnaire, particularly the section measuring skills gaps. Their contribution covered both basic and advantaged skill areas. The main changes were as follows:

* We shortened the questionnaire introduction to making it quicker and easier for interviewers.
* We added a new job title and department profiling question for the general audience (businesses, public sector organisations and charities) to better understand where cyber security responsibilities sat within organisations and whether these were labelled as cyber roles (addressing a specific research objective)
* We restricted the following questionnaire sections to cyber sector firms only: diversity, qualifications and recruitment. This followed the recommendations from the strand 1 methods review, which noted that these questions were either answered by too few respondents or not well understood by the general audience in 2018 to be useful
* We substantively overhauled the training section based on academic feedback. The new questions cover how well organisations think they understand their training needs, whether this is backed up by a formal analysis of training needs, which groups receive training, and the content and nature of this training (e.g. internal or external, mandatory or non-mandatory and graduate or non-graduate training)

Any new questions were typically added at the end of the relevant questionnaire section. This helped to avoid order effects which would limit the validity of trend data.

Many of the cyber sector firms interviewed for this study had also taken part in the earlier DCMS survey carried out in summer 2019, as part of the Cyber Sectoral Analysis 2020.9 To avoid asking these firms to repeat the same information in this latest survey, the survey script included a question that collected permission for us to reuse the data from the earlier survey, thereby filtering this sample out of several firmographic questions (on the size of their total workforce and their cyber workforce specifically).

Footnote 9: See [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-sectoral-analysis-2020](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-sectoral-analysis-2020).

Appendix D includes a copy of the final questionnaire used in the main survey.

### Sampling

The target population included:

* Private companies with more than one person on the payroll (i.e. excluding sole traders)
* mainly NHS organisations, academies and free schools (as other types of schools are run directly by local authorities) and local authorities (excluding parish councils)
* Registered charities
* Cyber sector businesses

We designed the survey to represent enterprises (i.e. the whole organisation) rather than establishments (i.e. local or regional offices or sites). This reflects that multi-site organisations will typically have connected cyber security infrastructure and will therefore deal with cyber security centrally.

Business and public sector sample frame (IDBR) and sample selection

The sample frame for businesses and public sector organisations was the government's Inter-Department Business Register (IDBR), which covers businesses in all sectors, including the public sector, across the UK at the enterprise level. This is the main sample frame for government surveys of businesses and for public sector organisations. Organisations in the agriculture, forestry and fishing sectors (SIC, 2007 category A) were excluded. DCMS judged cyber security to be a less relevant topic for these organisations, given their relative lack of e-commerce, and additional permission is needed to sample these organisations from the IDBR. This exclusion is also consistent with the 2018 study.

In total, we selected 48,702 businesses and public sector organisations from the IDBR. This year we selected more leads than in 2018 (when it was 37,871) because in our more recent experience of the IDBR we found that there were far fewer IDBR leads that had telephone numbers than in previous years.

We selected leads based on disproportionate targets by sector and by size. The disproportionate stratification reflected the intention to carry out subgroup analysis by sector and size. This would not be possible with a proportionate stratification (which would effectively exclude any meaningful number of medium and large businesses from the selected sample, as well as resulting in too few interviews in certain sectors). The boosted groups included:

* Small (10 to 49 staff), medium (50 to 249 staff) and large size bands (250+ staff)
* Education, finance or insurance businesses, transport or storage businesses and public sector organisations (which DCMS highlighted as important sectors)
* Health, social care or social work businesses (which the 2018 literature review suggested was a sector with a greater demand for cyber skills)
* Information or communication businesses (which are highly engaged with cyber security, according to findings from the separate DCMS Cyber Security Breaches Survey10 series) Footnote 10: See [https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/cyber-security-breaches-survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/cyber-security-breaches-survey).

Table 1 breaks down the originally selected sample by size and sector. As the survey outcomes later in this chapter show, only 9,966 IDBR leads were included in the final survey, with the rest being unusable (i.e. with no telephone number) or being held in reserve.

The target population of charities was all UK registered charities. The sample frames were the charity regulator databases in each UK country:

* The Charity Commission for England and Wales database: _[http://data.charitycommission.gov.uk/default.aspx_](http://data.charitycommission.gov.uk/default.aspx_)
* The Scottish Charity Regulator database: _[https://www.oscr.org.uk/about-charities/search-the-register/charity-register-download_](https://www.oscr.org.uk/about-charities/search-the-register/charity-register-download_)
* The Charity Commission for Northern Ireland database: _[https://www.charitycommissionni.org.uk/charity-search/_](https://www.charitycommissionni.org.uk/charity-search/_)

Again, this approach is consistent with the 2018 study.

In England and Wales, and in Scotland, the respective charity regulator databases contain a comprehensive list of registered charities. The Charity Commission in Northern Ireland does not have a comprehensive list of established charities. It is in the process of registering charities and building one.

Therefore, while the Charity Commission in Northern Ireland database was the best sample frame for this survey, it cannot be considered as a truly random sample of Northern Ireland charities at present. This situation is set to improve over time, as the database becomes more comprehensive.

As discussed in Chapter 1, the number of charity interviews was reduced this year to 201 (from 470 last year). The sample was proportionately stratified by country and disproportionately stratified by income band. This stratification reflects the fact that the variance in survey responses tends to be higher among larger (high-income) charities and because it would still allow some basic subgroup analysis by income band, despite the lower sample size.

As the entirety of the 3 charity regulator databases were used for sample selection, there was no restriction in the amount of charity sample that could be used, so no equivalent to Table 1 is shown for charities. In total, we sampled 562 charities to achieve 201 interviews.

#### Cyber sector sample frame and sample selection

For cyber sector firms, we used the DCMS sector database that was created as part of the Cyber Sectoral Analysis 2019 (also carried out by lpsos MORI and Perspective Economics). Perspective Economics built this sample frame, a list of 1,221 UK cyber sector firms, from the Orbis and Beauhurst databases. From this database, there were 904 records with telephone numbers.

All 904 leads were included in the survey. In other words, this survey was carried out using a census approach and achieved a simple random sample of 205 interviews.

#### Sample telephone tracing and cleaning (required for IDBR and Scottish charity samples)

Not all the original sample was usable. In total, 42,426 original business leads had either no telephone number or an invalid telephone number (i.e. the number was either in an incorrect format, too long, too short or a free phone number which would charge the respondent when called). For Scottish charities, there were no telephone numbers at all on the database.

We carried out telephone tracing through the DBS Data11 (matching to both their business and, for micro businesses and charities, residential number databases) to fill in the gaps where possible. This increases the amount of usable sample and helps to reduce the likelihood of non-response bias affecting the survey. There was already very high telephone coverage for charities from England and Wales (92% with telephone numbers), and Northern Ireland (100% with telephone numbers), which provided more than enough usable sample and already minimised the possibility of non-response bias. Therefore, as per the previous study, no telephone tracing was required for charities from England and Wales, and Northern Ireland.

Footnote 11: See [https://dbsdata.co.uk/](https://dbsdata.co.uk/).

We also cleaned the selected sample to remove any duplicate telephone numbers, and parish councils. Identifying and removing parish councils was a two-step process. Firstly, we removed all micro organisations in SIC sector O from the usable sample, as these were overwhelmingly parish councils. Secondly, we carried out a search on the remaining SIC sector O organisations for the phrase "parish council", "town council" or "community council" to highlight further leads for removal.

Following telephone tracing and cleaning, the usable business sample amounted to 11,731 leads (i.e. 24% of the original sample frame). The composition of this sample is shown in Table 2. For the Scotland charities sample, 2,786 leads out of the original sample frame of 24,680 leads (11%) had telephone numbers after matching.

The usable leads for the survey were randomly allocated into separate batches for businesses and charities. Each batch included leads proportionately selected to incorporate sample targets by sector and size band, and response rates by sector and size band, from 2018 and from previous batches. In other words, we selected more sample in sectors and size bands where there was a higher target, or where response rates were expected to be relatively low.

We drew up and released subsequent batches of sample as and when the live sample was exhausted. Not all available leads were released in the main stage (see Tables 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 for the total sample loaded).

The cyber sector sample did not require further telephone tracing or cleaning. This process had already been carried out in the previous survey conducted in summer 2019, as part of DCMS's Cyber Sectoral Analysis 2020.

### Piloting

Cognitive testing was required in 2018 when the questionnaire was developed from scratch. This year, much of the questionnaire remained unchanged or involved rerouting existing questions to the new cyber sector group. Therefore, cognitive testing was not required.

We conducted a live pilot for the surveys in the first 2 days of fieldwork. This involved daily written feedback reports from all interviewers working on the project for those days, daily monitoring of raw survey data, interview lengths and sample outcomes, and an open-ended question at the end of the survey where respondents could give feedback.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**SIC 2007** & **Sector description** & **Micro or small (1–49 staff)** & **Medium (49–249 staff)** & **Large (250+ staff)** & **Total** \\ \hline B, C, D, E & Utilities or production (including manufacturing) & 602 & 97 & 165 & 864 \\ \hline F & Construction & 768 & 47 & 62 & 877 \\ \hline G & Retail or wholesale (including vehicle sales and repairs) & 762 & 100 & 370 & 1,232 \\ \hline H & Transport or storage & 642 & 175 & 155 & 972 \\ \hline I & Food or hospitality & 431 & 78 & 86 & 595 \\ \hline J & Information or communications & 1,112 & 115 & 211 & 1,438 \\ \hline K & Finance or insurance & 626 & 215 & 110 & 951 \\ \hline L, N & Administration or real estate & 629 & 87 & 205 & 921 \\ \hline M & Professional, scientific or technical & 911 & 86 & 197 & 1,194 \\ \hline O & Other public sector & 19 & 168 & 99 & 286 \\ \hline P & Education (including academies) & 819 & 106 & 69 & 994 \\ \hline Q & Health, social care or social work (including NHS) & 795 & 125 & 41 & 961 \\ \hline R, S & Entertainment, service or membership & 357 & 45 & 44 & 446 \\ \hline  & Total & 8,473 & 1,444 & 1,814 & 11,731 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Post-cleaning available IDBR sample by size and sector We carried out 54 live pilot telephone interviews between 7 and 8 August, among the 4 audiences for the study (general businesses and public sector, charities and cyber sector firms).

Following the pilot, we made 2 minor sets of changes to the questionnaire:

* We added subheadings to the TITLE question to making coding of responses quicker for interviewers. We also added various codes to this question based on the "other" responses from the pilot
* We added new reassurances around confidentiality alongside the diversity questions

These 54 interviews were included in the final dataset, as the changes we made were not substantive enough to affect the comparability of findings before and after the pilot in any way.

### Fieldwork

All survey fieldwork (including the live pilot) was carried out from 7 August to 8 October 2019 using a Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) script.

In total, we completed 1,558 telephone interviews, comprising:

* 1,046 businesses (excluding agriculture, forestry and fishing businesses)
* 106 public sector organisations (excluding parish councils)
* 201 registered charities
* 205 cyber sector firms

The average interview length was c.15 minutes for businesses and public sector, c.16 minutes for charities and c.13 minutes for cyber sector firms.

#### Fieldwork preparation

Prior to fieldwork, the lpsos MORI research team briefed the telephone interviewers. The interviewers also received:

* Written briefing notes about all aspects of the survey
* A copy of the questionnaire and other survey instruments

#### Screening of respondents

Interviewers used a screener section at the beginning of the questionnaire to identify the right individual to take part and ensure the business was eligible for the survey. At this point, the following organisations would have been removed as ineligible:

* Organisations with no computer, website or other online presence (interviewers were briefed to probe fully before coding this outcome, and it was used only in a handful of cases)
* Organisations that identified themselves as sole traders with no other employees on the payroll

As this was a survey of enterprises rather than establishments, interviewers also confirmed that they had called through to the UK head office or site of the organisation.

When an interviewer established that the organisation was eligible, and that this was the head office, we asked them to identify the senior member of staff who has the most knowledge or responsibility when it comes to cyber security.

For UK businesses that were part of a multinational group, interviewers requested to speak to the relevant person in the UK who dealt with cyber security at the company level. In any instances where a multinational group had different registered companies in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland, both companies were considered eligible.

Franchisees with the same company name but different trading addresses were also all considered eligible as separate independent respondents.

Random-probability approach and maximising participationWe adopted random-probability sampling and interviewing to minimise selection bias. The overall aim with this approach is to have a known outcome for every piece of sample released. For this survey, we used an approach comparable to other robust business surveys and to the 2018 study:

* We called each piece of sample either a minimum of 7 times, or until we achieved an interview, received a refusal, or received enough information to make a judgment on the eligibility of that contact. Typically, we called leads 10 or more times (e.g. when respondents had requested to be called back at an early stage in fieldwork but had subsequently not been reached)
* Each piece of sample was called at different times of the day, throughout the working week, to make every possible attempt to achieve an interview. We also offered evening and weekend interviews on request to respondents

Several steps were taken to maximise participation in the survey and reduce non-response bias, beyond the general management and scheduling of the fieldwork and interviewing team to produce the best results. Interviewers could send a reassurance email to prospective participants to confirm the legitimacy of the study and provide more information. We also had a study website and GOV.UK page to reassure respondents that this was a bona fide government survey. Finally, we offered respondents a copy of the report and a government cyber security help card (reproduced in Appendix E) to encourage participation.

Fieldwork monitoringIpsos MORI is a member of the interviewer Quality Control Scheme recognised by the Market Research Society. In accordance with this scheme, the field supervisor on this project listened in on at least 10 per cent of the interviews and checked the data entry on screen for these interviews.

Fieldwork outcomes and response rateThe Ipsos MORI research team monitored fieldwork outcomes and response rates throughout fieldwork and gave interviewers regular guidance on how to avoid common reasons for refusal. Table 4.3 shows the final outcomes and the adjusted response rate calculation for business and public sector (the IDBR sample). Tables 4.4 and 4.5 shows the equivalent for charities and cyber sector firms.

Compared to 2018, the unadjusted response rate for the IDBR sample is slightly lower (11% this year, vs. 14% in 2018). For charities, it is higher (36% vs. 30%). The lower rate for businesses is potentially down to various issues, including a change in the fieldwork period from summer in 2018 to autumn in this latest survey, increasing awareness of cyber security potentially making businesses more reticent to take part and a more general decline in business survey response rates (regardless of the topic).

### Data processing and weighting

Identifying the type and characteristics of sampled organisations using sample information versus questionnaire information

The IDBR contains businesses that might also be registered charities. Moreover, the public sector organisations within the IDBR sample are split across several sectors (most commonly SIC 2007 sectors P, Q and O18), so cannot be fully identified at the sampling stage. We allowed all IDBR-sampled

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Outcome** & **Total** \\ \hline Total sample released & 904 \\ \hline Completed interviews & 205 \\ \hline Incomplete interviews & 6 \\ \hline Ineligible leads – established during screener & 0 \\ \hline Ineligible leads – established pre-screener & 6 \\ \hline Refusals & 176 \\ \hline Unusable leads with working numbers & 122 \\ \hline Unusable numbers & 26 \\ \hline Working numbers with unknown eligibility & 363 \\ \hline Expected eligibility of screened respondents & 100\% \\ \hline Expected eligibility of working numbers & 75\% \\ \hline Unadjusted response rate & 22\% \\ \hline Adjusted response rate & 31\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\end{table}
Table 4.5: Fieldwork outcomes and response rate calculations for cyberorganisations to self-identify as either a private sector organisation, public sector organisation or charity in the interview. We then took this as their designated status in the final data.

For size (or income band for charities), we primarily used information collected in the questionnaire, and where this was missing, we used the information in the sample frames to fill in the missing responses.

### Coding

The verbatim responses to unprompted questions could be coded as "other" by interviewers when they did not appear to fit into the predefined code frame. Ipsos MORI's coding team coded these "other" responses manually, and where possible, assigned them to codes in the existing code frame. It was also possible for new codes to be added where enough respondents - 10 per cent or more - had given a similar answer outside of the existing code frame. The accuracy of the coding was verified by the Ipsos MORI research team, who checked and approved each new code proposed.

We did not undertake SIC coding. Instead, we used the SIC 2007 codes that were already in the IDBR sample to assign businesses to a sector for weighting and analysis purposes. This is the same approach as in the 2018 survey and has been tested and validated in previous surveys, such as DCMS's Cyber Security Breaches Survey series.19 The sector groupings used in the main report match those shown in Tables 4.1 and 4.2.

Footnote 19: See [https://www.oow.uk/government/collections/cyber-security-breaches-survey](https://www.oow.uk/government/collections/cyber-security-breaches-survey).

### Weighting

For the IDBR and charity samples, we applied RIM weighting (Random Iterative Method weighting) to account where possible for non-response bias, and to account for the disproportionate sampling by size, sector and income band. The intention was to make the final reported data representative of the actual UK business, public sector and charity populations. This matched the weighting approach from 2018.

RIM weighting is a standard weighting approach undertaken in business surveys of this nature. In cases where the weighting variables are strongly correlated with each other, it is potentially less effective than other methods, such as cell weighting. However, this is not the case for this survey as organisation size and sector are not correlated.

We used 4 separate weighting schemes:

1. For businesses, there were non-interlocking weights by size and sector, based on the population profile in the 2018 Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) business population estimates (the latest ones published at the time of data processing).20 Non-interlocking weighting means that we did not weight by size _within_ each sector, but weighted the whole sample separately by size and then by sector. Interlocking weighting (i.e. weighting by size band within each sector) was also possible but would have potentially resulted in very large weights. This would have reduced the statistical power of the survey results without making any considerable difference to the weighted percentage scores for each question, so was not applied.

Footnote 20: See [https://www.oow.uk/government/statistics/business-population-estimates-2018](https://www.oow.uk/government/statistics/business-population-estimates-2018).

Very shortly after completing the data processing for this survey, BEIS published the 2019 estimates. While the 2019 estimates highlight an increase in the total number of businesses (an increase of 3.5% since 2018), we expected that this would have a negligible impact on the data, so have kept the weighting to match the 2018 estimates in the final data.

## 5 Qualitative interviews

Concurrently with the survey, lpsos MORI conducted 23 qualitative in-depth interviews in September 2019. This included 15 large organisations and 8 cyber sector firms. The balance of interviews towards large organisations reflects the fact that the quantitative survey estimates would be less reflective of these types of very large organisations. Because it was not feasible to cover them substantively in the survey, it became more important to cover a wide range of these organisations in this qualitative strand.

### Sampling and recruitment

DCMS provided lpsos MORI with a list of high-priority large organisations to contact for this strand. DCMS had notified these organisations of the research beforehand and encouraged them to take part. These organisations had not taken part in the quantitative survey. Given the small sample size, we informed all large organisations taking part that there was a small chance that DCMS would be able to identify them based on the research findings, even though we would exclude any names of organisations or individuals in the reporting - all organisations we spoke to were happy to take part on this basis.

The cyber sector sample was based on a recontact question from the quantitative survey, sampled at 2 points during fieldwork.

lpsos MORI recruited all the interviews by email and telephone. Our specialist business recruiter recruited from both the DCMS sample and the recontact sample built up during survey fieldwork. We offered a E50 charity donation incentive to each participant to encourage participation.

### Fieldwork

Each interview was carried out by telephone by one of the lpsos MORI core research team and lasted c.45-60 minutes.

The topics for discussion were compiled collaboratively between lpsos MORI and DCMS. The starting point was a list of topics identified as evidence gaps by Professor Furnell in the literature review. Further to this, lpsos MORI and DCMS also discussed the research topics that would better suit a qualitative approach during the development of the quantitative questionnaire.

The interviews explored the challenges these organisations faced in addressing skills gaps and shortages, and the approaches they were taking on recruitment, training, outsourcing and workplace diversity.

The full topic guides for large organisations and cyber sector businesses are contained in Appendix F.

### Analysis

Interviews were summarised in a notes template. Throughout fieldwork, the core research team discussed interim findings and outlined areas to focus on in subsequent interviews. DCMS also attended one of these discussions. At the end of fieldwork, we drew out key themes and case studies to include in the final findings.

## 6 Job vacancies analysis

Perspective Economics led this strand of the research. While it was carried out concurrently with the quantitative survey, the job data included in the analysis stretches from September 2016 to the end of August 2019, i.e. 3 years of data.

### Methodology

The Burning Glass Technologies definition of cyber job roles

Burning Glass Technologies22 has been tracking the cyber security job market since 2013. Its database has a basic filter for cyber security job postings based on job titles, required skillsets and certifications. This filter broadly covers, but does not distinguish between, roles that Burning Glass Technologies defines as "core" and "cyber-enabled". The difference between the two, adapted from the Burning Glass Technologies definition23, is as follows:

Footnote 22: This work was carried out using the Burning Glass Technologies Labour Insight tool: [https://www.burning-glass.com/products/labor-insight/](https://www.burning-glass.com/products/labor-insight/).

Footnote 23: See [https://www.burning-glass.com/wp-content/uploads/recruiting_watchers_cybersecurity_hiring.pdf](https://www.burning-glass.com/wp-content/uploads/recruiting_watchers_cybersecurity_hiring.pdf).

* Core cyber roles are formally labelled or commonly recognised as cyber security jobs. They have a greater demand for skillsets and tools directly related to cyber security, such as information systems, cryptography, information assurance, network scanners, and security operations. In other words, these are job roles where some aspect of cyber security is the main job function. This would typically include job titles such as Cyber Security Architect, Cyber Security Engineer, Cyber Security Consultant, Security Operations Centre (SOC) Analyst and Penetration Tester
* Cyber-enabled roles are not formally labelled or commonly recognised as cyber security jobs but require cyber security skills. Alongside cyber security skills, they demand more general IT and business skills, such as project management, risk assessment, network engineering, SQL, system administration, and technical support. This might be because the job requires light-touch knowledge and application of technical cyber security skills (e.g. for IT Technicians or Governance, Regulation and Compliance roles) or because the job role includes cyber security functions among other things (e.g. Network Engineers whose role is broader than just network security). Typical job titles, other than those already mentioned, include Computer Support, IT Support Analyst and Applications Analyst

It is important to note that both sets of job roles typically require a mix of technical and non-technical cyber security skills, so these cannot simply be differentiated as technical vs. non-technical jobs in cyber security.

Improving on the Burning Glass Technologies standard cyber security filter

Using the Burning Glass Technologies cyber security filter suggests that there were 188,264 cyber security job postings in the UK between September 2016 and the end of August 2019. However, we know that this filter is incomplete for the purposes of our analysis:

* It was important to have a more granular split between core cyber roles and cyber-enabled roles. While the Burning Glass Technologies filter aims to cover both, it does not distinguish between the twoFurthermore, it is common for cyber security job titles to have multiple or inconsistent meanings within the cyber sector and across sectors. For example, a "Security Lead" could refer to cyber security or to physical security. A "Risk Analyst" could refer to someone in cyber security or in the finance sector. This means that the Burning Glass Technologies filter could both exclude jobs that are cyber security jobs (false negatives) and include jobs that do not, in fact, include any cyber functions (false positives)

Perspective Economics sought to identify cyber security job postings in the UK using a more tailored and systematic approach than is applied by Burning Glass Technologies' standard filter. Our approach has clear inclusion and exclusion criteria and can be replicated. We sought to exclude common words and roles that might generate misleading findings, e.g. removing words such as "financial", "fire" or "CCTV" (indicating a different type of analyst or security role). We also excluded roles that mentioned "cyber security" but would be unlikely to employ core or cyber-enabled skillsets, such as sales, recruitment or human resources roles.

In order to develop this approach, we undertook the following iterative steps:

1. Initial identification of more granular search terms to use on the Burning Glass Technologies platform (which we aligned to the Cyber Security Body of Knowledge, or CyBOK24). Footnote 24: See [https://www.cybok.org/](https://www.cybok.org/).
2. Extracting an initial dataset from Burning Glass Technologies with over 300,000 job postings, using the identified inclusion/exclusion terms from step 1. Footnote 25: [https://www.cybok.org/](https://www.cybok.org/).
3. Reviewing the initial output and refining the inclusion/exclusion terms before extracting a second dataset from Burning Glass Technologies using the refined terms.
4. Supplementing the second dataset with Burning Glass Technologies' own cyber security filter, which we used to distinguish between core cyber roles and cyber-enabled roles.
5. Confirming the final number of job postings within scope for this analysis (using the final, refined search strategy) with DCMS.

Our refined search criteria yielded 105,194 core cyber security roles, and a further 288,063 cyber-enabled roles. In total this comes to 393,257 job postings in scope for this strand (compared to Burning Glass Technologies' own 188,264 job postings).

We have included the final inclusion/exclusion criteria in Appendix G.

### Metrics analysed

The analysis took advantage of the following data outputs from the Burning Glass Technologies database:

* The number of cyber security job postings in the UK, including a time-series analysis of the number of job postings posted each month over the last 3 years
* The industry sectors of the employers seeking people in cyber roles
* The geographic locations across the UK for these job postings
* Advertised job titles (to analyse the job roles most in demand)
* Job descriptions (to analyse the skills, experience, education, and qualifications being requested)
* The salaries or salary ranges being offered in these job postings

### Strengths and limitations of the methodology

This is an experimental methodology that adds a great deal of insight to the quantitative survey data, particularly around the geographical clustering of job postings. It also reinforces the survey findings in many areas, adding another layer of credibility to this data.

A summary of the advantages of this approach is as follows:

* **Volume and granularity -** we are able to analyse c.400,000 job postings from the last 3 years, exploring the specific jobs, skills and qualifications in demand. It can also drill down into areas such as the specific coding languages being sought. This method can uncover geographic clustering (down to specific towns and cities) of high demand and skills shortages for cyber professionals
* the highly up-to-date data on Burning Glass Technologies can provide insight into the labour market at that given moment in time. By contrast, survey statistics and other secondary data are typically several months or years old, and they are not regularly updated. This is especially important given the fast-moving nature of cyber security and the evolving demand for skills
* the Burning Glass Technologies platform scrapes more than 40,000 online data sources25. Online postings reflect an estimated 85 per cent of jobs posted in the labour market (versus, e.g. print media)

Footnote 25: See [https://www.burning-glass.com/about/faq/](https://www.burning-glass.com/about/faq/).

However, the findings are based solely on job postings recorded on the Burning Glass Technologies platform. This means that the data comes with the following limitations:

* Burning Glass Technologies only scrapes free-to-use jobs, which potentially leaves an (unknown) risk of bias if major employers are using closed platforms to post jobs, or other ways of recruiting such as networking and word-of-mouth. However, we believe this is offset by both the high volume and high coverage of the data that is available. This data still gives a strong insight into the trends and patterns in the labour market
* the Burning Glass Technologies interpretation of cyber security jobs is reliant upon their definition, based on the skills, job titles and qualifications expected for cyber roles. There is a risk that some roles within their interpretation may not truly be considered a cyber role (e.g. administrative staff working in the NHS responsible for document shredding, flagged as "Information Security"). This is the most substantial risk associated with this methodology and is why we have opted not to use the Burning Glass Technologies filter for our analysis, but instead to adopt a more bespoke search strategy, with the tailored inclusion/exclusion terms. These search terms reduce the risk of including non-cyber roles (false positives) within the analysis

## Appendix A: Literature review

### Introduction

This rapid evidence review examines recent literature on the cyber security skills shortage. The specific aim is to provide a review of the key studies and other publications that have emerged since the cut-off point for the original review in October 2018 (albeit with occasional reference to earlier studies that were not fully reviewed in the 2018 work).

The discussion is based upon an examination of a longlist of 47 sources in the main evidence review, plus a further 20 sources in relation to assessing actions being taken in the international context.

The review builds upon significant prior evidence that had already demonstrated a cyber skills shortage. As such, this update should not be expected to tell a fundamentally different tale, and it is too early for any resultant initiatives to have had an impact.

### The state of the cyber security skills shortage

There continues to be no shortage of sources suggesting a Cyber Security Skills Shortage (CSSS) in the UK and more widely:

* **International: _EY's Global Information Security Survey 2018-19_**reports that 30% of organisations are struggling with skills shortages (placing the issue ahead of budgetary constraints, cited by 25%).28 The situation is particularly acute in smaller organisations, where 56% indicate that they have skills shortages or budget constraints Footnote 28: © 2018. _Is cybersecurity about more than protection?_**_EY Global Information Security Survey 2018-19_**.**_EY_ (ISC)?: 2018. _Cybersecurity Professionals Focus on Developing New Skills as Workforce Gap Widans: (ISC)? Cybersecurity Workforce Study 2018._ [https://www.isc2.org/mediaISC2/Researchy2018-ISC2-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Study.ashx](https://www.isc2.org/mediaISC2/Researchy2018-ISC2-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Study.ashx).
* **International: _Enterprise Security Group's annual survey_** of the challenges facing IT professionals has consistently cited a 'problematic shortage' of cyber security skills as its top issue. As Figure 1 illustrates, there is a year-on-year increase in the percentage of organisations citing it as an issue28* **UK: _The Security Profession in 2018/19_** report from the Chartered Institute of Information Security takes a slightly more granular view and differentiates between shortages in terms of skills (10%), resources (21%), experience (13%) and new entrants to the profession (5%)23. The resulting conclusion was that the main problem exists in terms of the number of people with skills rather than the ability of those that are available Footnote 23: [https://www.open.ac.uk/business/bridging-the-digital-divide](https://www.open.ac.uk/business/bridging-the-digital-divide) (2019)
* **UK: _The Open University's Bridging the Digital Divide_** report presents specific evidence across Great Britain, with a survey of 500 CTOs, HR Directors and HR Managers across England region, Wales and Scotland. This revealed that across all regions, a third of the business leaders reported that they did not have adequate cyber security capabilities within their organisation30 Footnote 23: [https://www.open.ac.uk/business/bridging-the-digital-divide](https://www.open.ac.uk/business/bridging-the-digital-divide) (2019)

Somewhat surprisingly, further UK evidence from the _Cyber Security Breaches Survey 20193_1 suggests less of a problem, with 75% believing that the people dealing with cyber security in their organisation had the right cyber security skills and knowledge to do their job effectively and 79% believing that their organisation had enough people to manage the risks (meanwhile only 10% and 9% explicitly disagreed on these issues). These figures were broadly consistent, regardless of business size or whether the organisation was a business or charity. However, the response to a further statement ("I am not sure how our organisation should act on any advice I have seen or heard around cyber security"), was notably less confident, with 31% overall agreeing that they were not sure. Due to the wording of this statement, the result may reflect the respondents' own confidence about what to do, rather than imply that their cyber security team would not know how to act. Having said this, the findings are something of an outlier against the other evidence, and as the report itself observes: "Many organisations may assume they have the necessary skills, without fully understanding the technical requirements of the role".

Figure 1: International organisations globally reporting a ‘problematic shortage’ of cyber security skills

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:29]

consistent with the Cyber Seek data, in terms of the specialists and engineers being likely to account for the operational and provisioning roles, and analysis and governance-related vacancies being present but less prominent.

As a counterpoint to some CSSS percentages presented above, an extensive study supported by the _Global Cyber Security Center_ presents its own review of the international evidence37. It confirms the widespread perception of a cyber security skills shortage, but questions the extent to which the nature of the shortage, and the drivers behind it, are properly understood (citing several methodological factors that can call some of the specific reports into question - including ambiguous questionnaires and poor generalisability of the current data). At the same time, it agrees that there is sufficient weight of overall evidence to confirm a mismatch between demand and supply of cyber security skills. The study points to the need for further research, particularly in terms of defining the nature of the shortage and means of measuring it. There is a need to understand the causes of the shortage, the experience levels at which shortage occurs, and whether it is qualitative and/or quantitative in nature.

Footnote 37: The _Jobs per 1 million vacancies_ is the _Jobs per 1 million vacancies_.

**Implications for primary research:** It would be relevant to further investigate what _areas_ of cyber security are perceived to be in short supply. Do employers feel they have more difficulty recruiting some skills more than others? There would potentially be an opportunity to rate the perceived severity of the shortage across different skills/role categories. Similarly, it would be pertinent to examine whether the shortages relate to specific levels of practitioners' experience.

### What skills are needed?

While the earlier Cyber Seek and Indeed sources reported vacancies, a worldwide survey of 267 cyber security professionals conducted by _ESG/ISSA_ identifies the areas in which respondents reported their biggest cyber skills shortages38. As can be seen from the chart below, these are dominated by technical cyber security roles.

[MISSING_PAGE_POST]

Footnote 4
The _ISC2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study 2018_ presents an interesting assessment of the perceived importance of different forms of cyber security qualifications, with relevant work experience placed at the head of the list and academic degree qualifications at the bottom.

Aside from the general notions of knowledge and experience, the most prominent response relates to _Cyber security certifications_. However, with a myriad of certifications available, there is some variation of

Figure 4: Importance of different cyber security qualifications

Figure 3: Areas of biggest cyber skills shortage

importance in this category. The _ESG/ISSA study_ asked its respondents which of the cyber security certifications they held were most important in helping them to get jobs. This revealed ISC2's CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) certification as by far the most highly-rated (see Figure 5), and offers an interesting contrast to some further insight drawn from the _Cyber Seek vacancy data_ (see Figure 6). This clearly suggests an over-supply of certifications such as CompTIA's Security+ and a notable under-provision in terms of the certifications in greater demand (which are also those denoting more experienced practitioners).

### _Source:_ Cyber Seek (2018)

Having said all this, it is important to understand that cyber security professionals should not be characterised by technical skills alone. Two themes that emerge from the review are cyber security as a

Figure 5: Cyber security certifications most important to employment

Figure 6: Comparison of certification holders versus openings requiring the certification

cross-disciplinary issue, and the need for business understanding and soft skills to support technical ability:

* **UK:** While it is most readily recognised in the context of IT and computer science, _Collier and Martin_ note that the CSSS "extends to other disciplines and areas of expertise such as law, business strategy and public policy".39 They note that a siloed approach to the issue can result in non-optimal solutions, and propose that cyber security teams should incorporate an "electic range of skillsets and experiences" in order to achieve an interdisciplinary viewpoint  Footnote 39: Collier, J. and Martin, A. 2019. _Beyond Awareness: The Breachth and Depth of the Cyber Skills Demand_. Working Paper Series – No. 10, Centre for Technology and Global Affairs, University of Oxford. March 2019. [https://www.ctga.ox.ac.uk/article/Beyond-awareness-breachth-and-depth-cyber-skills-demand](https://www.ctga.ox.ac.uk/article/Beyond-awareness-breachth-and-depth-cyber-skills-demand)
* Part 1: Current Trends in Workforce Development. [https://cybersecurity.isaca.org/state-of-cybersecurity](https://cybersecurity.isaca.org/state-of-cybersecurity)

**Implications for primary research:** There is a clear challenge in knowing what the 'right skills' look like. Do employers feel that they understand what to look for in order to identify the skills they need (within their existing teams and among potential hires)? Do they feel that their existing security teams are able to relate to, and communicate with, the wider business? What do they look for during the recruitment process in terms of prior security experience, certifications, and wider skills? Are they prepared to recruit less experienced staff and enable them to undertake skills development?

**Impacts resulting from lack of skills**

Impact can be considered from the perspective of the business as well as effects upon the workers responsible for handling cyber security.

_ISC2's 2018 Cybersecurity Workforce Study_ reported that 59% of respondents believed their organisation was facing "extreme or moderate risk" as a result of cyber security staff shortage.

In terms of impacts upon the workers themselves, Figure 7 presents a chart taken from the _Symantec High Alert_ report. This is based upon a survey of 3,045 cyber professionals working in middle or upper leadership roles organisations (with the respondents split into approximately even groups from France, Germany and the UK). As can be seen, lack of skills is commonly reported, along with indications that the workload is too great to keep up with technology or maintain skills development. While the UK situation appears less severe than the average, all of the factors remain notable concerns.

**Source:** Symantec (2019)

Taking a wider geographic view, the aforementioned _ESG and ISSA study_ found that three-quarters of organisations are experiencing a cyber skills shortage, with a third citing a significant impact. The most common areas of impact were:

* Increased workload on existing staff (66%)
* Inability to fully learn or utilise security technologies to their full potential (47%)
* The need to hire and train junior employees rather than hire experienced staff (41%)
* Limited time for cyber security staff to work with business units to align security with processes (40%)

There were also various other lower-rated factors of note, such as a lack of time for staff to address strategy and planning due to the demands of incident response, and a high rate of attrition and burnout amongst cyber security staff (with both of these factors cited by around a third of respondents).

Figure 7: Impacts of the skills shortage

The top 4 factors from the previous years are summarised in the following table from the report, revealing that some areas of impact have remained fairly consistent in this timeframe.

### Top four areas of impact of cyber skills shortages

#### Source: ESG/ISSA (2019)

The ESG/ISSA report also notably points toward a "seller's market" for cyber security talent, with 76% of respondents indicating that they are solicited to change jobs by recruiters at least once a month, while almost half reported weekly contact. This, in turn, can have clear potential to impact the organisation, if it finds its existing cyber talent being lured away.

**Implications for primary research**: The skills shortage clearly has the potential to put pressure on existing teams. It would be relevant to further investigate whether organisations are feeling this and in what way(s) it is manifested. If the problem is experienced (or anticipated) are the organisations doing anything in response?

### Gender and Diversity

All of the data at present indicates that both the current workforce and the pipelines of future talent are significantly skewed towards male participants:

* **International:** The _ISC2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study 2018_ indicate that women represented 24% of the overall cyber security workforce
* while 79% of men believed that women were offered the same opportunities, only 41% of women agreed
* **UK: _The Security Profession in 2018/19_ report from the Chartered Institute of Information Security suggests a similar picture, insofar as only 9% of the respondents were women
* **UK:** Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) data reported in a _DCMS study of FEHE provision_ reported that approximately 16% of students undertaking a cyber security degree in 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4097]

* **UK:** The Department for Education has proposed _National standards for essential digital skills_47. Based upon the earlier essential digital skills framework, these standards address the population as a whole, and define essential digital skills for work and life. They address 5 thematic areas, the fifth of which is 'Being safe and responsible online'. This includes specific skills statements relating to protecting privacy and protecting data. The skills are defined at Entry Level (for those with little or no experience of digital devices and the Internet) and Level 1 (for those with some experience but still lacking secure basic digital skills). For cyber security they encompass aspects such as awareness of online threats, secure configuration and use of devices and services, and safeguarding against loss or inappropriate sharing of data. The standards are relevant in the context of the (future) workforce, insofar as staff entering the workplace with baseline cyber literacy would raise the bar in terms of protection and thereby adjust the emphasis of what cyber security professionals in the organisation would be required to safeguard
* they should be providing users with the skills to _deal_ with them

#### Implications for primary research

Enhancing the cyber security awareness and behaviour of the general workforce has the potential to reduce the challenge facing the specialists. It would therefore be relevant to investigate the extent to which organisations feel that they currently have a cyber security-aware workforce, and whether they are making provision to support them in this respect. To what extent do they perceive that their wider workforce is (directly or indirectly) causing workload impacts for their cyber specialists?

Recognising and retaining cyber security talent

A recurring theme in several recent studies is that organisations could be looking at their cyber security skill requirements in different ways and doing more to support retention of talent.

* **UK:** Drawing upon opinions from 60 industry experts, InfoSecurity Magazine's _State of Cybersecurity Report 2019_ flags two aspects that many organisations could alter in order to recruit and develop talent49: Footnote 49: ENSKA. 2019. Cybersecurity Culture Guidelines: Behavioural Aspects of Cybersecurity. European Network and Information Security Agency. December 2018. [https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cybersecurity-culture-guidelines-behavioural-aspects-of-cybersecurity](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cybersecurity-culture-guidelines-behavioural-aspects-of-cybersecurity)
* More realistic hiring processes, reducing the expectation new hires should be immediately deployable at a high level and are pre-equipped with the full technical background
* More resourcing for training to upskill junior people into senior security roles, which would position them to make better decisions without firstly having to accumulate years of prior experience

A further commentator went as far as to assert that there is no talent deficit and that the situation could be addressed if it was approached differently ("there are tons of people who would like a job in cyber and we shouldn't make it more difficult for them to get one")* Reflecting a view from IBM, Batten suggests ways of empowering existing in-house cyber security talent, based upon50: Footnote 50: [https://security.intelligence.com/think-inside-the-box-to-bridge-the-cybersecurity-skills-gap/](https://security.intelligence.com/think-inside-the-box-to-bridge-the-cybersecurity-skills-gap/)
* Creating a mentoring programme, to enable new hires to be supported by established cyber security staff
* Joining a professional organisation (e.g. ISACA, SANS or ISSA), in order to keep up to date with trends and developments
* Sharing best practices via community engagement, to enable interaction with a wider group of subject matter experts
* Matthews flags the need for creativity on the part of HR teams looking to manage the skills situation for their organisations51. This again includes the idea of developing and growing skills internally rather than external recruitment for non-urgent positions, as well as recognising that workplace initiatives can be used to support talent retention. Given that the skills shortage is a recognised cause of increased workload and resultant stress for current workers, initiatives such as free gym membership or other interventions supporting staff welfare could be considered
* **Europe:** Also linking to the welfare of the cyber workforce, the _ENISA Cybersecurity Culture Guidelines_ highlights that organisations should be looking after their staff in order to guard against burnout, and ensuring that there are opportunities for training and personal growth. Staff in incident response teams and security operations centres are highlighted for particular consideration, given the importance (and potentially stressful nature) of their role in protecting the organisation

Footnote 51: [https://www.informational.org/recruiting-in-the-age-of-the-cyber-security-skills-gap/](https://www.informational.org/recruiting-in-the-age-of-the-cyber-security-skills-gap/)

The points around developing talent and increased training raise the question about how organisations can make space for this given the demands already placed upon the workforce. _Symmetec's High Alert report_ acknowledges this, and highlights the need for "complementary alternatives that can help free up time for skills development and ease the recruitment burden". The following alternatives are suggested:

* Rationalisation (using integrated cyber system so that there are fewer distinct platforms/solutions to be managed)
* Embedded Security (so that it is provided within services such as web and email, without user intervention)
* Automation (to remove manual/repetitive aspects, as well as to leverage Al and Machine Learning to aid protection)
* Externalisation (using managed service providers to handle key aspects)

While none represent a panacea, they have potential to assist in the context of a fully-considered security strategy.

**Implications for primary research**: This links back to the earlier suggestion that the survey should investigate whether organisations feel they are making provisions to support a potentially overloaded workforce. Opinions and activities could be explored in relation to hiring strategy, mentoring, and welfare initiatives.

Supporting the skills pipeline

Reflecting on the establishment of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, Hannigan highlights the ongoing challenge of increasing the talent pipeline to support cyber, and the need for "strategic interventions in the education system to effect long-term change"SS2. He suggests that a specific focus should be upon fostering STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) skills at school level, supported by emphasis in the national curriculum and training for teachers. Hannigan observes that while initiatives such as _CyberFirst_ and the _Cyber Security Challenge UK_ have been positive, they are far from achieving the scale that has been achieved in the Israeli cyber education programme, which the UK activities have used as a point of reference.

Picking up on Hannigan's comment about STEM, and looking at the nature of the pipeline at present, it is possible to observe recent increases in the proportion of students taking STEM-based subjects, both at school and in higher education:

* At GCSE level across the UK, there were 2018 increases in entries into the individual sciences (23% in biology, 18.6% in chemistry and 17.2% in physics) and into computing (11.8%), although mathematics saw a 3% drop53 Footnote 1: [https://www.icsa.ac.uk/news/17-01-2019/sb252-higher-education-student-statistics/subjects](https://www.icsa.ac.uk/news/17-01-2019/sb252-higher-education-student-statistics/subjects).
* At A Level, the most significant rise in 2018 was in computing (with a 23.9% increase in candidates), while biology, chemistry, mathematics and physics all saw more modest increases, in the 2.5% to 3.5% range54 Footnote 1: [https://www.icsa.ac.uk/news/17-01-2019/sb252-higher-education-student-statistics/subjects](https://www.icsa.ac.uk/news/17-01-2019/sb252-higher-education-student-statistics/subjects).
* In Higher Education, there were 2017/18 increases in students studying biological science (3%), physical sciences (1%), mathematical sciences (2%) and computer science (6%)55, with all but physical sciences also having increased the prior year

Additionally, DCMS's prior investigation of cyber skills development reports on the provision of cyber security courses in the higher education (HE) and further education (FE) sectors. Figure 8 contrasts the number of students studying on Information Communications Technology (ICT) and cyber security courses at the FE and HE levels in the 2016/17 academic year, and has a clear relationship to feeding the pipeline that could address skills shortages. While the inclusion of cyber security content into programmes will not directly develop cyber security professionals and practitioners, it will help to ensure that more graduates are aware of the issue and better positioned to develop further.

Having said this, it should be acknowledged that not all cyber professionals need or have an ICT background. Many current practitioners are working effectively having come into the profession via non-IT and non-cyber routes, and this should continue to be the case (which also relates back to the earlier observation about the cross-disciplinary nature of cyber security). This recognition already exists within initiatives such as the NCSC's _CyberFirst Bursary_ and _CyberFirst Degree Apprenticeship_ schemes, both of which accept applications from candidates with non-IT (and indeed non-STEM) backgrounds56.

Footnote 56: See [https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/section/education-skills/11-19-year-olds/section](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/section/education-skills/11-19-year-olds/section) 4

Footnote 57: EDUCAUSE: 2019. _Technology in higher education: shaping the future IT workforce_. EDUCAUSE and Jisc Joint Report. 9 April 2019. [https://www.jisc.ac.uk/reports/technology-in-higher-education-shaping-the-future-it-workforce](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/reports/technology-in-higher-education-shaping-the-future-it-workforce)

In the UK, a _2019 report by EDUCAUSE_ looks at the IT workforce more generally and makes interesting observations around what those recruiting and working with IT staff may be looking for in terms of non-technical, soft skills, such as communication, teamwork and attitude57. This has implications for the cyber security workforce, again highlighting the need for cyber professionals to be suitably versed in Skills Group J (i.e. Management, Leadership, Business and Communications) from the IISP Skills Framework. The same report additionally observes that technical skills will change in ways that cannot currently be foreseen and that those required in a decade will have little resemblance to what organisations need today. This highlights a need for agility in academic programmes and training provision, as well as the need to support Continuing Professional Development (CPD) courses within the cyber workforce.

Footnote 58: 2019. _Technology in higher education: shaping the future IT workforce_. EDUCAUSE and Jisc Joint Report. 9 April 2019. [https://www.jisc.ac.uk/reports/technology-in-higher-education-shaping-the-future-it-workforce](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/reports/technology-in-higher-education-shaping-the-future-it-workforce)

**Implications for primary research**: Cyber security is not exclusively about technical skills and consequently those contributing to it should not be exclusively from IT or STEM backgrounds. It would be relevant to explore the extent to which organisations understand and share this view.

### Industry and Professional Initiatives

#### ISP Frameworks

While the CSSS is often referred to in generic terms, it is clear that cyber security is a diverse topic, requiring a range of supporting skills. As such, it is useful to have a frame of reference to understand what the underlying skills actually _are_, which can then be used to determine how they relate to the areas

Figure 8: Students studying ICT and cyber security courses in Further and Higher Education (2016/17)

of short supply. Useful contributions here are offered by the **Chartered Institute for Information Security** - formerly the Institute of Information Security Professionals (IISP) - which has devised a series of frameworks that can assist in understanding and expressing the needs. These individually seek to address Skills, Knowledge and Roles.

Providing overall context is the _IISP Skills Framework_, version 2.3 of which was released in November 201858. This defines 32 Skills Groups (split across 10 thematic sections) which collectively encompass a range of technical and non-technical skills in cyber security, as well as more general business and professional skills (the demand for which has been highlighted other evidence). Each of the skills can then be rated at 6 levels, ranging from basic knowledge through to denoting a lead practitioner. The key opportunity arising from this is the ability to map against the framework:

Footnote 48: IISP. 2018. _IISP Skills Framework - Version 2.3_, November 2018. The Institute of Information Security Professionals. [https://www.ilsp.org/issp/Development/Our_Frameworks/IISP_Skills_Framework/ispy2/Accreditation/Our_Skills_Framework.aspx](https://www.ilsp.org/issp/Development/Our_Frameworks/IISP_Skills_Framework/ispy2/Accreditation/Our_Skills_Framework.aspx).

* Individuals can map themselves in terms of current and target levels
* Roles and vacancies can be mapped in terms of the skills they need
* Organisations can map their teams in order to understand existing skills and gaps
* Qualifications and certifications can be mapped in terms of their coverage

While the Skills Framework expresses what someone should be able to do, the IISP Knowledge Framework59 focuses upon what they need to know in order to do so. It specifically aims to define the knowledge required by Cyber Security professionals at levels 1 and 2 (i.e. to cover knowledge and understanding of basic principles). It is less relevant in the context of this review but is mentioned for completeness.

Footnote 59: IISP. 2019. _IISP Roles Framework - Version 0.3_, March 2019. [https://www.ilsp.org/issp/Development/Our_Frameworks/IISP_Roles_Framework/ispy/About_Us/Our_Roles_Framework.aspx](https://www.ilsp.org/issp/Development/Our_Frameworks/IISP_Roles_Framework/ispy/About_Us/Our_Roles_Framework.aspx).

The most recent contribution is the accompanying _IISP Roles Framework60_. This takes eleven common roles (including CISO, Pen Tester, Security Architect, and Threat Analyst) and maps them to the primary and secondary skills areas that are considered relevant (as well as the qualifications and experience that one might expect to see). The Roles Framework is in a pre-release version at the time of writing but seems likely to provide a useful reference resource as it matures.

Footnote 60: IISP. 2019. _IISP Roles Framework - Version 0.3_, March 2019. [https://www.ilsp.org/issp/Development/Our_Frameworks/IISP_Roles_Framework/ispy/About_Us/Our_Roles_Framework.aspx](https://www.ilsp.org/issp/Development/Our_Frameworks/IISP_Roles_Framework/ispy/About_Us/Our_Roles_Framework.aspx).

#### Implications for primary research

The fact that there is a (newly chartered) UK professional body, the UK Cyber Security Council, specifically linked to cyber security raises the question of whether organisations are looking for (or would consider) such a professional membership as a relevant indicator in their hiring process. It would also be relevant to examine awareness of the related Frameworks, and whether these are considered to be something that the organisations would aim to use.

#### The Cyber Security Body Of Knowledge (CyBOK)

The CyBOK is an NCSC-funded initiative aiming to develop "A comprehensive Body of Knowledge to inform and underpin educational and professional training for the cyber security sector" (see www.cybok.org). More specifically, it is intended as _guide_ to the body of knowledge that already exists, mapping this to a series of specific cyber security Knowledge Areas defined by the project.

The CyBOK work commenced in 2017, and an overview of the 19 top-level Knowledge Areas was included in the original review. The full set of 19 Knowledge Areas have now been released as v1.0. This gives confidence that the project will ultimately deliver full releases across the full set of areas.

The CyBOK is relevant as it will become the frame of reference for other activities, such as the NCSC's certification scheme for Bachelors and Masters degrees in cyber security.

**Implications for primary research**: Again, it would be relevant to explore awareness of the initiative and the contribution that it could make to the hiring process.

### International initiatives

Having reviewed the evidence in general terms, and established an ongoing and internationally recognised concern, this section aims to examine other nations approaches to addressing their current cyber security skills gap and what can be learnt from them.

From the general evidence review, it was identified that the _'Mind the Gap'_ report from the _Global Cyber Security Center_ had already examined the cyber security policies of 12 countries (Australia, Estonia, France, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States). These dated from 2015-2018 and consistently highlighted a need for cyber skills, plus (in most cases) a concern regarding shortfall in the available supply. The report also summarised what the countries are doing in order to respond to the shortages, with the focus across 4 areas:

* Primary and secondary education
* Vocational education and apprenticeships
* Higher education and research
* Workforce

Those countries with longer-standing cyber security strategies (e.g. Japan and the US, alongside the UK) are shown to have more established and wide-ranging programmes in place to support them. In the education space, the efforts are found to be more prominently focused around higher education and research, with various countries establishing programmes such as academic centres of excellence, certified degrees, and direct funding of research. In the workforce context, efforts are directed towards both recruitment and retraining.

Given that the aforementioned review was itself relatively recent, a further assessment would seem unlikely to reveal significantly different findings. Nonetheless, the topic space is dynamic and there have indeed been some recent developments from some of the countries listed above, plus others that were sampled. As such, the sections below present related summaries relating to activities from 10 individual country approaches, as well as a summary level look at the situation regarding compliance with cyber awareness and education recommendations in the European context from ENISA. The selected countries encompass the Five Eyes (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, United States) plus a sample of other countries that were highlighted during the evidence review and/or considered of potential interest (Ireland, Israel, Norway, South Africa, South Korea).

### Australia

The Australian government has a range of cyber-related initiatives, within the over-arching context of the _2016 Cyber Security Strategy_, to which the government committed $230M. The most notable aspects from a skills and workforce perspective are as follows61:

Footnote 61: Australian government. _government Initiatives – Cyber Security_. Department of Industry, Innovation and Science. [https://www.industry.gov.au/data-and-publications/australias-tech-future/government-initiatives/cyber-security](https://www.industry.gov.au/data-and-publications/australias-tech-future/government-initiatives/cyber-security)

* encourages more students to study cyber security and related courses, supported by $1.9M of Cyber Security Strategy funding, shared between the University of Melbourne and Edith Cowan University
* AustCyber (The Australian Cyber Growth Network) has assisted the development of cyber security qualifications at TAFE (Technical and Future Education) providers
* an initiative seeking to address the underrepresentation of women in Australia's cyber security workforce

Linked to this, the 2018 update of _Australia's Cyber Security Sector Competitiveness Plan62_

indicates progress in relation to activities to increase the awareness of cyber security careers:

Footnote 62: AustCyber. 2018. _Australia’s Cyber Security Sector Competitiveness Plan - 2018 Update. 27 November 2018._

* "AustCyber has begun releasing a suite of interactive dashboards on cyber security careers, training opportunities, roles and career paths
* "LifeJourney, a new online career mentoring offering in Australia, has launched a Cyber Schools Challenge in various States. The programme seeks to ignite high school students' interest in cyber security careers"

The dashboards can be found at [https://www.austcverb.com/resources/education-dashboards](https://www.austcverb.com/resources/education-dashboards), and offer an interesting opportunity to explore security roles (based upon the structure proposed by the NICE Framework), available education opportunities, and the availability of cyber security challenge competitions. Figure 9 illustrates the Education Map, which allows interactive exploration of cyber security education offerings at different providers across the country, allowing filtering by various characteristics, including region and level of study.

Canada

The **National Cyber Security Strategy**63 highlights the need for skills, recognising that better provisions are needed across the population ("from our children to our elderly"), and across organisations ("from our small and medium business owners to our law enforcement agencies and corporate executives"). It is also recognising that attracting and retaining the required talent is difficult as a result of short supply.

Footnote 63: Public Safety Canada. 2018. _National Cyber Security Strategy - Canada’s Vision for Security and Prosperity in the Digital Age_. 12 June 2018. [https://www.publicasafety.gc.ca/cn/rsrcs/pblctrs/trtni-cbr-scrt-strtg/index-en.aspx](https://www.publicasafety.gc.ca/cn/rsrcs/pblctrs/trtni-cbr-scrt-strtg/index-en.aspx)

In terms of addressing the issue, reference is made to the necessity of "working together across governments, academia, and the private sector" to address the cyber skills gap. More specifically, it makes broad reference to the need to encourage more students to move into STEM fields, as well as encouraging graduates from STEM and other disciplines (e.g. management, psychology or sociology) "to specialise in the skills needed for cyber security jobs". The Strategy also refers to the importance of attracting such multidisciplinary talent from abroad as well as domestically. Beyond this, however, the document does not articulate any specific steps toward achieving the goals.

Figure 9: AustCyber’s Education Map dashboard

#### Ireland

A draft public consultation document on the **National Cyber Security Strategy** was published in March 201964. This recognises the critical importance of a skilled cyber security workforce, combined with the dual challenges of an existing skills shortage and fewer young people regarding cyber security as a career path.

Footnote 4: Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. 2019. _National Cyber Security Strategy Draft Public Consultation_, March 2019. [https://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/communications/convoluments/Documents/87/consultations/National%20Cyber%20Security%20Strategy%20Constitution%20Document.pdf](https://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/communications/convoluments/Documents/87/consultations/National%20Cyber%20Security%20Strategy%20Constitution%20Document.pdf)

A 3-year Cyber Security Skills Initiative was launched in October 2018, with the aim of developing awareness, bridging the skills gap and setting standards for skills and competencies for Cyber Security roles. Focus areas will include CPD and attracting women into the sector, and Skillnet Ireland anticipates delivering related training to >5,000 people in the industry during the 3-year period.

The consultation poses questions over what can be done to improve the availability of skilled workers, as well as supporting the relationship between academia and industry in order to foster and maintain a skills pipeline.

#### Norway

The context is set by the **National Cyber Security Strategy for Norway**. The List of measures to support the strategy includes a specific recommendation to "include cyber security in the corporate culture"65. This recognises that employees at all levels have a role to play and emphasises the need for companies to ensure that their staff have the necessary knowledge and skills to do so. Suitable training tracks should be available for all employees at all levels, and those supporting key services require specific attention.

Footnote 65: Norwegian University. 2019. _LList of measures – National Cyber Security Strategy for Norway_. 30 January 2019. [https://www.rejeringen.no/en/dokunter/national-cyber-security-strategy-for-](https://www.rejeringen.no/en/dokunter/national-cyber-security-strategy-for-) Norway/id26271177/

Additional reference is made to a **National Strategy for Cyber Security Competence** (only available in Norwegian). According to a summary at EuroJice, "The strategy sets out conditions for long-term competence building, encompassing national capacity in the fields of research, development, education, and measures designed to raise awareness in the business community and among the general public"66. It is noted that capacity in ICT-related education programmes, including digital security, has been increased by 1500 in order to meet demand.

Footnote 66: Euryice. 2019. “Norway – National Redforms related to Transversal Skills and Employability”, 29 March 2019. [https://eacea.ec.europa.eu/national-policies/euryice/content/national-reforms-related-transversal-](https://eacea.ec.europa.eu/national-policies/euryice/content/national-reforms-related-transversal-) Skills-and-employability-48_en

A series of resultant measures from the competence strategy are summarised below.

### Israel

Israel is widely regarded as one of the most successful cyber security economies, and is in many ways the reference point for other national approaches.

A recent article identifies 3 ways in which Israel has provided a particular environment for fostering cyber security talent and activity67:

Footnote 67: [https://www.cybersecurity.com/](https://www.cybersecurity.com/)

* **Mandatory Military Service -** All citizens must serve approximately 2 years in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), a long-standing model (since 1949) that has evolved from cryptography and signals intelligence to focus on "military-grade" cyber skills. It is claimed that 90% of adult Israelis working in the high-tech sector have undertaken military service
* **Unit 8200 -** The country's signals intelligence function similar to GCHQ or NSA, which has the opportunity to screen IDF entrants before they enter the service and take its pick of the candidates. The top talent can therefore be steered towards cyber security activities
* **Government Planning and Investment -** The level of investment sends a clear message of cyber security as a national priority (e.g. the Israeli Innovation Authority, the Ministry of Economy and Industry, and the National Cyber Directorate recently announced a further $24m programme of funding, adding to existing innovation centres and incubators that have been established)

Such activities are supplemented by further initiatives to identify and engage talent, such as after-school clubs run by defence agencies. Additionally, former leaders of Unit 8200 have created Team8 (see www.team8.vc), which describes itself as a "think-tank and company creation platform" and acts as an

Figure 10: Priorities from the Norwegian National Strategy for Cyber Security Competenceincubator for cyber security companies. Such activities illustrate how cyber security is receiving particular emphasis in wider society, but supported and influenced from IDF sources.

It is clear that several elements here would not be easily replicable in other countries (e.g. as the approach depends heavily upon conscription and has evolved from a long-standing position), but there are elements that can be adapted to suit other contexts (e.g. GCHQ funding students on the basis of them going to work in cyber security areas).

#### New Zealand

The new _Cyber Security Strategy 2019_, published in early July, identifies 5 priority areas, the first 2 of which pertain to cyber awareness and skills amongst the workforce68:

* Cyber security aware and active citizens
* Strong and capable cyber security workforce and ecosystem

The former refers to general cyber security awareness amongst the population, and the need to support them via associated awareness and education. Meanwhile, the cyber security workforce priority highlights a series of points in which related action should be taken:

* Incentivising and increasing the supply of skilled cyber security workers
* Supporting the expansion of roles and opportunities for cyber security workers
* Incentivising the growth of the cyber security industry in New Zealand
* Supporting industry and professional organisations to promote responsible management of cyber security across their organisations and workplaces
* Encouraging the development of a world-class cyber security academic research community
* Supporting high-quality cyber security research and encouraging links between academia and industry

The document does not go into further detail about how these will be achieved, but it is clear that the general principles expressed tend to echo the themes already being enacted through initiatives in other countries.

#### Singapore

Singapore's Cyber Security Strategy is based around 4 pillars, the third of which is 'Developing a vibrant cyber security ecosystem'. Within this, a number of initiatives were pursued in 2018 in relation to the enhancement of the cyber security capability base and talent pool. Quoting from the _Singapore Cyber Landscape 2018_ report, the following initiatives are of potential note, all of which were established or launched in 201869:

Footnote 69: CSA. 2019. _Singapore Cyber Landscape 2018_. Cyber Security Agency of Singapore, June 2019. [https://www.csa.gov.sg/~/media/csa/documents/publications/cassaingaporecyberlandscape2018.pdf](https://www.csa.gov.sg/~/media/csa/documents/publications/cassaingaporecyberlandscape2018.pdf)

* **Lean LaunchPad Programme Cybersecurity Track:** a 10-week experiential learning programme to equip cyber security researchers and young start-ups with the necessary networks, tools, and market validation to bring their inventions to market.
* **National Satellites of Excellence (NSoEs)**. Anchored in local universities, these aim to build and consolidate local research strengths in domains of national interest (specifically Trustworthy

Various technology occupations are identified, and as a specific example the OFO code 2017-252901 denotes an ICT Security Specialist.

The intention is to link various occupations to specific skills, identify further training needs, and then engage private service providers to develop cyber security training programmes. It will also define a framework of job descriptions relating to the cyber security careers necessary for the industry, accompanied by the educational requirements to ensure that candidates have the appropriate level of expertise to address the responsibilities of the role.

Thus, overall the aim is towards better understanding of cyber-related career paths, recognition of the skills that are needed to support them, and provision of education and training to increase the supply.

South Korea

A _National Cybersecurity Strategy_ was released in April 201972. It recognises the shortage of cyber security expertise in the face of increasing demand. The strategy indicates the intention for related action ("We will foster cyber security talent and continue to support the development of the cyber security industry"). Two of the specific Strategic Tasks within the document expand upon aspects relevant to improving cyber security capabilities. Specifically, under Task 4 (Build Foundations for Cyber security Industry Growth) there are sub-tasks relating to the specialist workforce:

Footnote 72: National Security Office. 2019. _National Cybersecurity Strategy_. Republic of Korea, April 2019. Publication Registration Number 12-1025000-00003-01. [https://www.msit.go.kr/cms/www/work/ic/_csFiles/afieldfile/2019/04/03/?1=4/01/01/02/03/%1=4/03.pdf](https://www.msit.go.kr/cms/www/work/ic/_csFiles/afieldfile/2019/04/03/?1=4/01/01/02/03/%1=4/03.pdf)

_Strengthen the competitiveness of the security workforce and technology:_

* Equip cyber security personnel with world-class expertise and competitiveness to respond to sophisticated cyber security threats
* Strengthen customised personnel development programmes to provide businesses, government, the military and society with a cyber workforce equipped with diverse capabilities
* Devise measures to improve cyber security expertise and recruit talented personnel

Meanwhile, under Task 5 (Foster a Cyber Security Culture), there are points relating to raising the capabilities of the more general user population:

_Raise cyber security awareness and strengthen cyber security practice:_

* Develop and distribute basic rules of cyber security so people can realise the importance of cyber security and easily put such rules into practice in their daily lives
* Develop and employ education programmes for cyber ethics and security customised to specific sectors of society, such as students, government officials, military personnel, and company employees
* Strengthen corporate social responsibility of businesses to protect cyber space and maintain an appropriate level of security in their products and services

However, the Strategy does not go beyond these high-level aspirations, and makes reference to the _National Cybersecurity Basic Plan_ and the _National Cybersecurity Implementation Plan_ as future initiatives that will give shape to the actual implementation 

### United States

The **Executive Order on America's Cybersecurity Workforce73** was issued in May 2019, which recognises the need to enhance the workforce mobility of cyber security practitioners, indicating that government policy must facilitate the seamless movement of practitioners between public and private sectors. It cites a requirement for "innovative approaches" to improve access to training and the need to enhance opportunities around work-based learning, apprenticeships, and blended learning, and applying to both new entrants in the workforce and workers at advanced stages in their careers.

Footnote 73: [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-americas-cybersecurity-workforce/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-americas-cybersecurity-workforce/)

In relation to the federal workforce:

* Establishment of a cyber security rotational assignment programme for the Federal cyber security workforce, to enable a knowledge transfer and a development programme for cyber security practitioners. This will include training and peer mentoring, with the Department of Homeland Security sharing cyber security experts with other agencies and taking staff from other agencies to work in DHS. The NICE Framework will be used as the basis for identifying and describing the cyber security skill requirements for programme participants

In the more general workforce context:

* A national Call to Action to highlight, and mobilise public and private sector resources to address cyber security workforce needs
* Align education and training with employers' cyber security workforce needs
* Encourage the voluntary integration of the NICE Framework into existing education, training, and workforce development efforts

There is also the proposal for 2 annual initiatives to recognise cyber security talent:

* A President's Cup Cyber Security Competition for Federal civilian and military employees, that aims to recognise the best government practitioners and teams in offensive and defensive cyber security disciplines
* A Presidential Cyber Security Education Award for school educators in cyber security and related subjects, with awards to one elementary and one secondary level educator per year

### European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA)

ENISA has developed a National Cyber Security Strategy Good Practice Guide, the most recent version of which is from 201674. This includes a number of Key Performance Indicators that are intended to allow policy makers to track the success of the implementation of strategic objectives. Two sets of these indicators are broadly related to the area of cyber skills, and are presented below, directly as expressed in the guidance:

Footnote 74: ENISA. 2016. _NCCS Good Practice Guide - Designing and Implementing National Cyber Security Strategies_. 14 November 2016.

* **Raise user awareness:** Indicators for the performance of user awareness measures are the number of campaigns and similar events arranged by public and private entities. These measures should focus on areas, in which a lack of awareness or knowledge has been identified
* The existence of measures to identify target areas for awareness raising* The areas/topics covered by awareness raising campaigns (e.g. end-user, children, Critical Information Infrastructure Protection)
* The number of public awareness raising events (e.g. conferences, workshops)
* The number of corporate in-house awareness raising measures
* **Strengthen training and educational programmes:*
* Education about information security as well as skilled personnel in key positions is imperative to increase the overall level of national cyber security. Typical KPIs include:
* The number of cyber security courses established
* The number of annual information security events (e.g. hacking contests or hackathons)
* The number of accredited or certified personnel in the private and public sector

The following table summarises the status of the implementation of these aspects within the EU Member States and EFTA countries encompassed by the report at the time of its publication in late 2016. While the majority are demonstrating attention to both areas, the picture was clearly not consistent across the countries assessed.

### User awareness and education initiatives in EU Member States and EFTA countries

An interactive online map at [https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss:map](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss:map) lists 8 additional countries addressing both areas (Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway Poland, Romania, the Slovak Republic, and the UK). Meanwhile, the Czech Republic addresses only the awareness category (which is now titled Citizen's Awareness in the latest materials), and the Netherlands only addresses training and education programmes. None of the gaps indicated in the table have yet been filled.

### Lessons from the international landscape

The clear and common finding is there are national cyber security strategies highlighting the need to attend to reskilling/upskilling within the current workforce, alongside to grow the pipeline of future talent via education and research. There are no major revelations in terms of the ideas and initiatives being pursued from one country to another (although some points of interest were highlighted in the summaries), and in most cases too early to see any impact (the notable exception here being Israel, which can be regarded as a beacon in terms of the influence its approach appears to have had upon others).

There are nonetheless some useful points that can be highlighted, drawing upon some of the specifics indicated above:

* A key theme that is apparent from various initiatives is the attempt to align efforts from education, research, and training through to the workforce. This coordination is typically achieved through the over-arching context of a national cyber security strategy
* Efforts are being made to support growth of the cyber security talent pool. This includes:
* Schemes to encourage and enable individuals to engage with cyber security, particularly at earlier stages and recognising that the target audience is diverse and extends beyond computing topics
* Support for the establishment of new education and training programmes. This can include both financial support (in terms of priming programme development and offering scholarships).
* Routes to enable individuals with relevant skills to further develop towards specialisation in cyber security (as with the Singaporean CSAT programme)
* Enabling a better understanding of cyber careers and routes into the profession. Provisions such as a the AustCyber dashboards have potential to be of benefit in this context to raise awareness, while the formal definition of occupations/roles (as seen in South Africa) helps to target efforts towards those that are needed
* It is desirable to ensure recognition of existing professionals, via awards for those holding skills and supporting others to acquire them. Linking back to the earlier evidence of workload and stress, any initiatives that help individuals to feel valued are likely to be beneficial
* Initiatives need to be targeted across the board, from school education, through HE and into CPD contexts. There is not a single route into cyber security, and the skills shortfall can be addressed by harnessing both new entrants and career changers, plus recognising the need for existing professionals to develop and maintain their skills
* It is important to recognise the need to support the general workforce and specialist cyber skills. Effective citizen awareness initiatives have the potential to reduce the challenges that specialists then need to address as a result of staff within their own workplace

Interestingly, much of this is already encapsulated within UK strategy such as _Scotland's Learning & Skills Action Plan for Cyber Resilience7_ and _the UK's Initial National Cyber Security Skills_

#### Strategy6

The fundamental principle of this plan is that cyber resilience (and the opportunities arising from it) will not be achieved unless it is embedded across the learning and skills system (as illustrated by the continuum in Figure 11).

The plan identifies 4 resulting aims as below (as well as 37 underlying actions for addressing them):

* Increase people's cyber resilience through awareness raising and engagement
* Explicitly embed cyber resilience throughout our education and lifelong learning system
* Increase people's cyber resilience at work
* Develop the cyber security workforce and profession to ensure that skills supply meets demand and that skilled individuals can find rewarding employment in Scotland

The resulting initiative represents an integrated approach, with collaboration between government, academia and industry, with the potential for positive effects across the identified continuum.

## Appendix B: training provider interviews topic guide

### Introduction

* This is part of a wider programme of research on cyber security skills in the UK. These conversations with training providers are about understanding the training products and services market. Primarily (FOR CONTEXT AND NO NEED TO READ OUT):
* The types and categories of things on offer
* Where the is demand from and what types/content of training they want
* Where the demand is heading in the next 2 to 5 years
* The scale and scalability of their offer, and the challenges around this
* MUST READ OUT: _All responses are confidential and anonymous. DCMS won't know who has taken part and will get an anonymised report pulling out the key findings across all interviews._
* MUST GET PERMISSION TO DIGITALLY RECORD FOR ANALYSIS (AND EXPLAIN WE WONT ATTRIBUTE) AND TO SHARE THIS RECORDING WITH RESEARCH PARTNER: _We're doing this research with a partner organisation (Perspective Economics/lpsos MORI) and would like to share the recording with them. They and we will securely destroy it after the research is complete. Can I just check this is okay with you?_

### Training offer (c.15 minutes)

_WARM UP: Tell me a bit about your organisation and your role within it._

_What kinds of products and services do you currently offer? How would you categorise the product or service lines your offer?_

* What's the best way of categorising it? By training content, delivery channel, who it's targeted at etc.?
* What types of organisations or individuals use their products and services?
* Do they focus on a particular kind of training or do everything?
* What is most in demand right now? What type/categories? Anything less in demand/less needed than before? Why do they think this is?

_How do clients find you?_

* Do they find them through word-of-mouth, internet searching, direct marketing etc.?

_Where does your business fit into the rest of the cyber skills training market?_

* What is the industry like? Lots of small providers offering niche products/services, or a few all-round providers offering a range of solutions?
* What is their business model? What made them go with this approach? How is this similar/different to other providers?
* What kinds of other models/provision are out there?

_Does your training lead to any qualifications?_

* Which qualifications?
* How much does this matter to clients? What difference would it make if they didn't emerge with a qualification? What kinds of clients does this appear more/less to?

_How do you see demand changing over the next 2 to 5 years?_

* Any particular types of training increasing in demand? Move to products or services? Move towards/away from tailored training? Need for cheaper/broader training? Demand from new types of businesses (e.g. size and sector)?What innovation is taking place in the market? New delivery channels/products/services? Where is the demand coming from for these new things?
* Are they/have they made any changes in anticipation, e.g. new courses/ products/services? Are they planning to do this?

### Clients and demand (c.15m)

#### How would you describe your "typical" clients?

* Do you provide training mainly for organisations or do you also provide training to individuals who come to you directly?
* do they only work locally or more widely? How feasible is it to go wider than this?
* Focus on particular sizes of clients or industry sectors, e.g. financial services? Do different sizes/sectors have different needs?
* Do certain types of clients have similar needs or is it unique for each client?
* How stable has this been? Have your clients changed over the past few years? What do you expect over the next 2 to 5 years?

#### How aware are clients of their training needs?

* How informed are client organisations and individuals within client organisations when choosing training products and services?
* Do clients know what kind of training they want from the start, or does the training provider have to suggest what kind of training the client might want/need?
* If you are dealing with individuals directly, how informed are they when choosing training products and services?
* Do they provide a fixed "off-the-shelf" product or service, or whether they have tailored offers for each client?

#### How big is your demand currently?

* Probe on the scale of their offer i.e. what volume of clients they can/do service.

#### How scalable is your offer? How easily could you expand to serve more clients?

* How easily or quickly do they think they could do this?
* Probe on constraints/challenges to scaling up (e.g. staff numbers, their own skills shortages/gaps, investment/access to finance)
* What actions would they need to take to grow supply?

### Other issues - partnerships, initiatives and diversity (c.10m)

#### We will know what to probe here based on the company descriptions in the sample.

#### Do you have any partnerships (formal or informal) with academic institutions or other businesses?

If YES, PROBE:

* What are the most important impacts they think come out of this partnership?
* Does this help to provide a route into industry for training recipients? Do they partner with any businesses to place the trained individuals in jobs/work experience?
* Are they collaborating with businesses to offer them any tailored products or services?
* How does it help tackle skills shortages? Does it help the training provider better align their training with industry needs?

Are you involved in any government-sponsored schemes for cyber skills and training, such as Cyber First, Cyber Discovery or the Cyber Skills Immediate Impact Fund?

If YES, PROBE:

* What do they feel has changed as a result of the scheme, e.g. have they increased provision of products/services or do they offer a new product/services?Do your training products/services have any focus on improving diversity and accessibility in the sector?

If YES, PROBE:

* How does this work? Have you moved away from traditional learning methods to support this? What has worked well?
* How has it broadened participation? Any examples of where it has led to people considering cyber security as a career where they might not have before?

#### Wrap-up

* Is there anything that we haven't discussed that you would like to raise?
* READ OUT: _Ipsos MORI and Perspective Economics are carrying out further research including a telephone survey as part of this study on cyber security skills. Would you be happy for Ipsos MORI or Perspective Economics to share your contact details, so that we can recontact you if needed for the next stages of the project?
