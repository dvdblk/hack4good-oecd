## Executive Summary

### Introduction

The Employer Skills Survey (ESS) has run biennially since 2011, providing a vital source of intelligence on the skills issues employers face. ESS traditionally has an inward-looking focus assessing the current skills position and skills needs of employers. It has sat alongside the Employer Perspectives Survey, which is primarily outward-looking, covering provision of and engagement with the wider skills system. In ESS 2019, the two surveys were, in effect, merged, by incorporating EPS questions as modules.1 In total, 16,070 respondents across England, Northern Ireland and Wales answered questions from the apprenticeships and traineeships module.

Footnote 1: From 2010 to 2017, the ESS survey and the EPS were conducted in alternate years (UK EPS was not undertaken in 2018). This means that comparisons over time refer to different survey years depending on whether the measure being referred to originated from the ESS or EPS survey prior to 2019. The report commonly refers to the last two waves of these surveys (i.e. ESS 2015 and 2017 and EPS 2014 and 2016).

This report focuses on findings relating to apprenticeships and traineeships, making up one of four thematic reports to supplement the core ESS findings on skill-shortage vacancies, skills gaps and key training measures.

### Engagement with apprenticeships

Overall nearly one in five establishments reported that they _either_ currently have apprentices at their site (10%), _or_ that they offer apprenticeships but do not have anyone undertaking one currently (8%). This is consistent with the figure seen in 2016. However, the profile of employers offering apprenticeships has seen considerable change, in particular in relation to the size of establishment. Medium and large establishments (25 or more staff) were much more likely to report that they currently offer apprenticeships in 2019 than they were in 2016 or 2014. Over the same period the proportion of smaller establishments (fewer than 25 staff) doing so was much reduced2.

Footnote 2: This mirrors changes in apprenticeship starts in England (Apprenticeships in England by Industry Characteristics 2018/19 Academic Year).

The most common reasons for offering apprenticeships were to do with acquiring talent, both for the establishment and for the industry. Overall half (50%) of establishments that had recently started offering apprenticeships gave this as a reason. Approaching a quarter (23%) gave altruistic reasons for offering apprenticeships and a fifth (21%) saw apprenticeships as a good way of nurturing talent.

Financial reasons were mentioned by 9% of employers that offered apprenticeships, however this rose to 36% among those with 100 or more staff. This was specifically with regards to the introduction of the levy, suggesting that among this group one of the impacts of the apprenticeship funding reforms is that the financial motivators for offering apprenticeships now take precedence over the need to acquire talented people and over the desire to do "a good thing" for the young people involved.

Employers that did not use apprenticeships most commonly believed they were not suitable for their size of establishment (20%) or that they were not planning to take on new staff (18%). Smaller establishments with 2 to 4 staff were more likely to mention various barriers including apprenticeships not being suitable due to their size (25%), their not looking to recruit any staff (22%) and apprentices not being needed because their staff were fully skilled (15% vs. 13%).

Among those who had apprentices the majority (60%) had just one, but 3% reported having 10 or more. Looking at apprentices as a proportion of employees shows there were 47 apprentices for every 1,000 employees in establishments with apprentices, and 18 apprentices per 1,000 employees across the economy as a whole.3 In large employers the number of apprentices per 1,000 employees had almost doubled since 2016, showing that not only are more engaging with apprenticeships but also offering them to more people than previously. Administrative data corroborates these findings, showing that apprenticeship starts have become more concentrated among larger employers since the introduction of the levy and other reforms to the apprenticeship system in England.

Footnote 3: Note that all volumetric data covered in this report reflect the number of _current apprentices_ reported at the time of interview based on survey data, collected at _establishment_ level across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Administrative data on apprenticeship _starts_ at enterprise level by academic year in England can be found here: DFE: _Apprenticeships in England by industry characteristics 2018 to 2019_.

In terms of using apprenticeships as a means to recruit staff, overall 62% of employers that had recruited people specifically as apprentices in the last three years had retained at least one of their apprentices onto a permanent contract once their apprentices finished. Of the 25% who had not taken on any, it was most commonly the apprentice's decision not to stay, although some also said it was because the apprentice was not capable enough in their role.

## Routes into apprenticeships

Most establishments offering apprenticeships (88%) offered them to young people (for the purposes of this section "young people" is taken to mean anyone under the age of 25). This was lower than seen in 2016 (93%). Apprenticeships are also available for those aged 25 or over, and 57% of establishment offering apprenticeships had at least one apprentice in this age group; this was higher than in 2016 (48%).

The majority of employers that offered apprenticeships (87%) offered them to new employees who they recruited specifically as apprentices. Nearly half (46%) offered apprenticeships _only_ to this group (i.e. they did not also offer them to existing staff). Around half of employers offering apprenticeships (52%) did so to existing employees, and one-in-ten (10%) offered apprenticeships _only_ to this group. This was most common among large establishments, with 100 or more staff, with the proportion of establishments offering apprenticeships to existing staff increasing almost 1.5 times, from around a half to around three-quarters in establishments in this size band. This suggests that in order to utilise their levy payments to their own benefit, they are increasing the number of existing employees they offer apprenticeships to.

Among employers that currently offer apprenticeships to new recruits, almost two-fifths (37%, equivalent to around a third (32%) of all employers offering apprenticeships) had used work experience placements to determine whether an individual would be suitable for an apprenticeship prior to recruiting them as an apprentice

## Traineeships

In England, approaching half (45%) of employers reported that they were aware of Traineeships, although around two-fifths (43%) of those aware (equivalent to 20% of all employers) did not know anything more than the name. The proportion that had had someone undertake a Traineeship in the previous 12 months was 3%, up from 1% in 2016.

In Wales, just over a quarter (28%) said they had heard of the Traineeship programme in Wales, and 2% had taken someone on as part of the Traineeship programme in Wales.

## Awareness and impacts of apprenticeship policy reforms

Approaching two-fifths (37%) of all employers were aware of the introduction of the levy payment. Awareness of the finer details of the levy payment among those who had heard of it were mixed, however. Around six-in-ten (58%) were aware that it applies to employers with a wage bill of \(\upvarepsilon\)3m or higher and 52% were aware the amount levied was 0.5% of the wage bill. Two-thirds (68%) of employers that had heard of the levy in England (the only country this element of the reforms affects) were aware the levy money can be used to offset an employer's own apprenticeship costs.

In England, the proportion aware of the requirement to contribute 5% towards the cost of an apprenticeship was lower than awareness of the levy, with just over a quarter (27%) of those aware of apprenticeships were aware that this was the case. Fewer than a quarter (22%) were aware that training providers receive a premium for recruiting apprentices from deprived areas; and 35% knew that a minimum of 20% of the apprentices' paid hours needed to be allocated to off-the-job training.

Awareness of the levy reforms was higher among the larger establishments across the board, particularly with regards to the levy payment.

Just under a quarter (23%) of employers that were aware of any of the recent reforms and also currently offered apprenticeships said there had been changes in the apprenticeship offering at the site. This was most commonly changes to the proportion of apprenticeship starts at the site that were undertaken by existing employees (14%), and the overall number of apprentices at the site (12%). In the majority of cases this change had been an increase, although a few had stopped offering or decreased their apprenticeship numbers.

## Future engagement in apprenticeships

Of those that had any apprentices or offered apprenticeships at the time of interview, the majority (87%) said they planned to continue offering apprenticeships, and approaching a fifth (18%) of establishments that did not offer them planned to do so in the future. This equates to 30% of all employers having planned to offer apprenticeships in the future. It is known from previous editions of the Employer Perspectives Survey series that employers' stated intentions for offering apprenticeships in the future do not necessarily materialise, at least not to their fullest extent; furthermore, employer intentions will often have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.4 Nevertheless it is useful to be able to identify the potential number of employers interested in offering apprenticeships and to identify the characteristics of these employers.

Footnote 4: Given that survey fieldwork took place some months prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, results that present a picture of employers’ future intentions in relation to apprenticeships are likely to have changed radically. Caution should therefore be taken in interpreting these findings, particularly in terms of the scale of employers’ intentions. However, the results provide a useful picture of how future intentions at the time had changed compared with 2016 and provide a pre-Covid-19 baseline on which to compare future survey findings.

Three-in-ten (30%) employers that offered apprenticeships and planned to continue doing so had expected the number of apprentices at their site to increase in the next two years, most commonly due to business growth. This compares with just 4% who expect the number to decrease; the main reason given by these employers was that they were not looking to take on any new staff.

Hotels and Restaurants (50%) and Public Administration (46%) establishments were more likely to have expected an increase, matching patterns reported in 2016. By size, smaller employers with 2 to 4 staff were less likely to expect an increase in apprentice numbers compared with 2016.

## 1 Introduction and Background

### Background to the Employer Skills Survey

Since 2011, the Employer Skills Survey (ESS) has been conducted biennially, providing a vital source of intelligence on skills challenges faced by employers, both in terms of those faced when recruiting and those relating to employees in their current workforce. The survey also explores the relationship between skills issues and training activity. The 2019 survey marks a change from previous waves of ESS, by, in effect, merging the content of ESS with that of the Employer Perspectives Survey (EPS), which traditionally has had a more outward-looking focus, covering employer engagement with the wider skills system5.

Footnote 5: The EPS survey was last run as a standalone survey in 2016, and covered the whole UK (see: [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/employer-perspectives-survey-2016](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/employer-perspectives-survey-2016)). It was also run separately in Scotland in 2019:

To integrate the two surveys, EPS questions were run as separate modules within the survey, with each module answered by a random subgroup of respondents. This approach meant that EPS measures were covered without adding considerable length to the survey, and at the same time enabled sufficient sample sizes to be achieved for detailed analysis of these measures. The Apprenticeships and Traineeships module was asked of 16,070 respondents across England, Northern Ireland and Wales (a full breakdown is provided in Table A.2.1 in Appendix A.

A separate 'core' report covers the key inward-looking ESS measures including recruitment and skill-shortage vacancies; their internal skills challenges; and the key aspects of training and workforce development. We report modular measures in separate thematic reports. This report specifically explores employer engagement with, and attitudes towards, apprenticeships, as well as potential future engagement in apprenticeships, with a view to exploring where and how engagement with apprenticeships can be increased. The other thematic reports explore training and workforce development; current and future skills needs of employers; and the skills pipeline.

## Policy background

Apprenticeships are paid jobs which incorporate on- and off-the-job training, and hence combine practical training in a job with study. Apprentices work alongside experienced staff, gain job-specific skills, earn a wage and get holiday paid, and are given time for study related to their role. Apprenticeships are available at a number of levels, from Level 2 (called Intermediate apprenticeships in England and Foundation apprenticeships in Wales) through to those at Level 6 and 7 (Degree apprenticeships).

Skills and training (and hence apprenticeships) are devolved policy areas.

In **England,** the Government's Productivity Plan and _'English Apprenticeships: Our 2020 Vision'_ both made the case for apprenticeships improving productivity and helping economic prosperity, confirmed the target of 3 million apprentice starts by 2020, and continued the drive to deliver high quality apprenticeships. More generally, apprenticeships are central to the Government's vision to improve skills, build sustainable growth and to enable individuals to succeed and progress in their careers. Recent policy developments have been oriented toward driving up quality while at the same time delivering increased apprenticeship starts, and with a focus on the central role of employers in the design of suitable apprenticeships. These policy developments have included:

* The move from frameworks to standards, with frameworks being gradually phased out;
* New requirements for minimum levels of off-the-job training;
* Changes to the approach to apprenticeship assessment (standards require end point assessment);
* The establishment of the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education to oversee quality and to approve apprenticeship standards and assessment plans; and
* Increased emphasis on Maths and English.

This has been accompanied by changes to the funding of apprenticeships, seeking to address perceived employer under-investment in training coupled with the need to fund the desired increase in apprenticeship volumes. The apprenticeship levy was introduced from May 2017, payable at 0.5% of the pay bill of employers in the UK whose annual pay bill exceeds PS3m (estimated to be some 2% of all employers). Employers in England can access their levy funds through digital service account to pay for approved apprenticeship training. Non-levy payers need to make a 5% contribution toward the cost of apprenticeship off-the-job training, with the Government covering the remainder. Funding bands have been put in place to determine the maximum amount the Government is prepared to contribute towards off-the-job training and assessment for an apprenticeship: there are now 30 of these funding bands for different apprenticeship standards and frameworks, ranging from PS1,500 to PS27,000.

In **Wales,** the Welsh Government's latest apprenticeship policy was published in February 2017.6 This expressed the aim to deliver a minimum of 100,000 apprenticeship places up to 2022 to meet and support the process of aligning the skills people gain and the skills the economy needs. The Welsh Government pays for the training element whilst the employer pays for the employment costs, such as salary. The funding supports both new entrants as well as those that are already in employment wishing to up-skill.

Footnote 6: Welsh Government, _Aligning the Apprenticeship model to the needs of the Welsh economy_ (2017)

The Welsh Government's Apprenticeships skills policy plan outlined several key delivery priorities relating to Apprenticeships for the 2016-2022 period, including:

* Using apprenticeships to address acute skills shortages by developing apprenticeships in key growth sectors and emerging job categories;
* Introducing an all-age approach for apprenticeships;
* Contributing to growth by focusing on apprenticeships at higher skill levels;
* Improving performance measures via a greater focus on the achievement of meaningful and sustainable employment;
* Improving access, equality and equity of opportunity;
* Delivering opportunities to undertake apprenticeships in Welsh;
* Developing skills pathways via stronger cooperation between academic and vocational education; and
* Establishing a new system for framework review and development to ensure apprenticeships are designed to meet employer needs.7Northern Ireland's strategy on apprenticeships was published in 2014, outlining 20 policy commitments. These focused on establishing the components of an apprenticeships; increasing participation by diversifying the apprenticeship offer and providing financial support; facilitating partnerships with key stakeholders in the apprenticeship system; and introducing measures to improve apprenticeship quality.8

Key aspects of the strategy that have been implemented include:

* The establishment of a Strategic Advisory Forum to guide strategy implementation;
* The establishment of Sectoral Partnerships to give employers a say in apprenticeship training curriculum;
* Sector Partnership review of over 50 apprenticeship frameworks or framework pathways; and
* Responding to increasing employer demand for Higher Level Apprenticeships by working with local further education colleges and universities to fund programme development and delivery.

In Northern Ireland, funding for the off-the-job training element of Level 2, Level 3 and Higher-Level apprenticeships at Level 4 and Level 5 is funded, provided through the Northern Ireland European Social Fund (ESF) Programme 2014-2020 and the Department for the Economy (DfE).9

Footnote 9: [https://www.hpc.org/](https://www.hpc.org/)

Footnote 10: Department for Education (DfE) and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, _Traineeships_:

_Supporting young people to develop the skills for apprenticeships and sustainable employment: Framework for Delivery_* (2013)

Working alongside apprenticeship provision, traineeships were first introduced in **England** in 2013,10 with the objective of equipping young people with the skills and experience needed to secure an apprenticeship or other job, therefore supporting young people's progression into employment, and reducing the proportion of young people who are not in education, employment or training (NEET). Traineeships are funded by the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA),11 and combine work preparation training with a training provider, alongside support in maths and English where required, and an unpaid work placement with an employer. Traineeships are open to 16 to 24-year olds, or 25-year olds with an education, health and care (EHC) place, and last for between 6 weeks and 6 months.

While similar to apprenticeships in terms of the combination of training and work experience, traineeships differ in that they are not jobs, and are only open to young people; they are therefore regarded as an important stepping stone into apprenticeships for young people who would otherwise lack the entry requirements.

The Traineeship scheme in **Wales**, which is separate to the English scheme, is funded by the European Social Fund (ESF) and aimed at young people aged 16 to 18 in Wales. Traineeships are available at three levels (Engagement, Level 1 and Level 2) and involve training at a training provider alongside work placements, with the aim of preparing the learner to move into paid work, an apprenticeship or further education.12

Footnote 12: Careers Wales. _Traineeships_[Accessed April 2020]

In **Northern Ireland**, the Training for Success programme currently delivers vocational training to young people at Entry Level to Level 3. From September 2021, this will be replaced by the NI Traineeship (primarily for Level 2) and Skills for Life and Work (an interim programme primarily for Entry Level and Level 1). These programmes involve training, achievement of qualifications, and work placements.

## Methodological overview

This section briefly summarises the key features of the methodology for ESS 2019, further detail of which can be found in the published technical report on the gov.uk website. As in previous iterations of ESS, the survey was carried out in two parts, both of which were conducted by telephone: a core survey of establishments and a follow-up survey looking at the investment employers had made in providing training to employees in the previous 12 months (the "Investment in Training Survey").13

Footnote 13: More information about the methodology for the Investment in Training Survey can be found in the Training and Workforce Development thematic report

### Sampling

The population covered by the survey comprised employers in England, Northern Ireland and Wales at the establishment level (rather than at an organisational level)14 with at least two staff on the payroll. Sole traders with a single person on the payroll were excluded.

The survey covered all sectors of the economy (the commercial, public and charitable spheres). The profile of this population was established through Office for National Statistics (ONS) data from the March 2018 Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR), the most up to date business population figures available at the time of the survey.

The sample of establishments was primarily sourced from the commercial data supplier Market Location. This was supplemented by records supplied directly through the IDBR to improve coverage of establishments in specific sectors and parts of sectors that are underrepresented in Market Location's database.

Quotas for the main survey were set by size within sector separately for Wales, Northern Ireland and eight English regions, while in one region, the West Midlands, a slightly different approach was adopted. In this region a Random Probability Sampling method was trialled, with no quotas and instead interviews were attempted with all sample records loaded.

### Questionnaire

ESS 2019 was designed to merge the ESS and EPS surveys to provide greater efficiency and to enhance the potential for cross analysis. The surveys were required to be combined in such a way that interview length stayed below 25 minutes: a longer survey would have impacted on response rates and the quality of information provided. To avoid an excessively long questionnaire the merger of two surveys required more extensive modularisation of the questionnaire than undertaken previously.

Questions that were included in the merged questionnaire were designed to be as consistent as possible with previous versions of the same question in order to ensure comparability over time.

### Fieldwork

Fieldwork for the core survey was undertaken between May and December 2019 and involved 81,013 interviews. Fieldwork was conducted by three research agencies (IFF Research, BMG Research and Ipsos MORI). An overall response rate of 41% was achieved for the core survey.

### Weighting

Findings from the core survey have been weighted and grossed up to accurately represent the total population of establishments in England, Northern Ireland and Wales with at least two people on their payroll, calculated using the March 2019 IDBR population statistics. This has been done on a size, sector and geographic basis. Separate weights were generated which allow findings to be presented (a) based on the number of workplaces reporting a particular experience, and (b) based on the number of employees and/or job roles affected by different challenges. For questions that were modularised (i.e. only asked of a random selected sample of respondents), modular versions of the workplace and employee weights were created.

### Report coverage

This report covers:

* The proportion of employers offering apprenticeships, the number of apprentices they currently have, the type of apprenticeships they offer, why employers that have started offering apprenticeships in the last three years did so, and the retention of apprentices over the last three years within the workforce;
* Awareness and impact of recent policy developments, particularly in relation to the apprenticeship levy (for employers in England and Wales);
* For those that do not offer apprenticeships, their level of knowledge about apprenticeships, and why they do not offer them; and
* Employers' future engagement in apprenticeships.15

Footnote 15: It is likely that future intentions will be heavily affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, however these results are still useful in terms of understanding which types of employers tend to have an appetite to take on apprentices.

### Reporting conventions

The terms "establishment", "employer" and "workplace" are used interchangeably throughout this report to avoid excessive repetition.

Throughout the report unweighted base figures are shown on tables and charts to give an indication of the statistical reliability of the figures.

From 2010 to 2017, the ESS survey and the UK EPS were conducted in alternate years (UK EPS was not conducted in 2018). This means that comparisons over time refer to different survey years depending on whether the measure being referred to originated from the ESS or EPS survey prior to 2019. The report commonly refers to the last two waves of these surveys (i.e. ESS 2015 and 2017 and EPS 2014 and 2016).

In tables, "zero" is denoted as a dash ("-"); and an asterisk is used ("**) if the figure is larger than zero but less than 0.5%.

Throughout the report, figures with a base size of fewer than 30 establishments are not reported (a double asterisk, "**, is displayed instead), and figures with a base size of 30 to 49 are italicised and should be treated with caution.

The scale and scope of data collected in ESS 2019 means that it is a valuable research resource supporting detailed and complex statistical analysis of the inter-relationships between employer characteristics and their practices and experiences. The findings presented in this report reflect a descriptive exploration of the data. All differences referred to in the text are statistically significant at the 95% level of confidence. Further statistical information can be found in Appendix D.

## 2 Engagement with apprenticeships

### Chapter summary

Around a fifth of employers either employed apprentices at the time of interview (10%) or offered them but did not have any current apprentices (8%). The overall proportion of employers offering apprenticeships (18%) was the same as in 2016 (after an increase from 15% in 2014). The likelihood of offering apprenticeships increases with size, from 9% among those with 2-4 staff to 80% among establishments with 250 or more staff. Offering apprenticeships was most common in sectors dominated by large and / or public sector establishments such as Education (36%), Public Administration (25%), Health & Social Work (25%) and "traditional" apprenticeship industries such as Construction (24%). In contrast, only around one in ten employers in the Primary Sector and Utilities (9%); Information and Communications (10%); and Transport and Storage (11%) offered apprenticeships.

In line with 2016, the most common reasons for starting to offer apprenticeships were related to acquiring talent (50%), such as their being a good way to acquire skilled staff (37%). Around a quarter (23%) mentioned altruistic reasons, in particular, offering them to give young people a chance (20%), while a fifth (21%) started offering them as a good way of nurturing talent.

Among those not offering apprenticeships, around three-fifths (62%) mentioned perceived structural barriers, including, most commonly, apprenticeships not being suitable for the size of their establishment (20%). A third (32%) said they had made an active choice not to offer apprenticeships, while one in ten (9%) mentioned reasons indicating a lack of awareness or knowledge of apprenticeships.

Among those that had recruited people specifically as apprentices in the past three years and had seen apprenticeship completers, seven in ten (70%) had retained some of their apprentices as permanent staff, and approaching half (44%) had retained all their apprentices. The most common reasons for not doing so related to it being the apprentice's decision (51%), including them not wanting to stay in their role (29%).

## Introduction

This chapter explores employers' level of engagement with apprenticeships at the time they were interviewed in terms of whether they currently have apprentices or offer apprenticeships and apprentice volumes per 1,000 employees. It also explores employers' reasons for offering or not offering apprenticeships and the extent to which employers retain apprentices as permanent employees.

### Engagement with apprenticeships

Nearly one in five employers either had apprentices at their site at the time of the interview (10%) or offered apprenticeships but did not have any current apprentices (8%). The overall proportion offering apprenticeships (18%) was the same in 2016, and remained higher than 2014 (15%). The overall proportion with current apprentices in 2019 (10%) was lower than in 2016 (12%).

The proportion of establishments offering apprenticeships was higher in England (19%) than in Wales (16%) or Northern Ireland (12%). Figure 2-1 shows the breakdown by country over time. While the overall proportion offering apprenticeships has not changed significantly in each nation, there has been a fall compared with 2016 in the proportion of establishments with apprentices at the time of the survey in Northern Ireland (by two percentage points) and in England (by one percentage point).

**Figure 2-1 Changes over time in the proportion of employers offering**

**apprenticeships, by country16**

Footnote 16: In Figure 2-1, the header for the columns for the combined England/NI/Wales figure in 2016 and 2019 both show 18% despite looking as though they are a different size. The difference in the size of the columns is due to the rounding of the figures in the chart.

**Figure 2-2 shows the breakdown by country, sector and size in the proportion offering apprenticeships.**

**The likelihood of offering apprenticeships increases with size, from 9% among those with 2-4 staff to 80% among establishments with 250 or more staff. Whilst the overall proportion of establishments offering apprenticeships has not changed since 2016, there have been changes by establishment size, as shown in Figure 2-3.**

**Figure 2-2 Proportion of establishments offering apprenticeships (by country, size and sector)**

Establishments with 25 or more staff were much more likely to offer apprenticeships in 2019 than in 2016 or 2014, with this increase particularly large among those with 100 or more staff. This was true for all nations; the biggest increase occurred in Wales, where there was an 18 percentage point increase in the proportion of employers with 100 or more staff offering apprenticeships (68%, compared with 50% in 2016), compared a with 14 percentage point increase in England (from 52% in 2016) and a 12 percentage point increase in Northern Ireland (from 34% in 2016).17 Compared with 2019, fewer of the smallest establishments (with fewer than five staff) offered apprenticeships (a fall of two percentage points).

Footnote 17: Increase in Northern Ireland should be treated as indicative due to low sample size in 2019 of 45 respondents.

The majority of the difference among large establishments with 100 or more staff was in the proportion who had apprentices at the time of the survey (41% in 2016 rising to 55% in 2019). The reasons for these changes are explored in the section below.

Across England, Northern Ireland and Wales as a whole the only significant change has been a two percentage point increase in proportion offering apprenticeships in the Wholesale and Retail sector, however at an individual country level the changes in this sector were not significant.

Figure 2.4 Changes over time in the proportion offering apprenticeships, by sector in each country

Reflecting the differences discussed by sector (and also by employer size), there were differences in the likelihood of offering apprenticeships by establishment type. Public sector establishments were almost twice as likely to offer apprenticeships (30%) as those operating in the private (18%) or charity/voluntary (16%) sectors. These proportions are in line with 2016, when 29% of public sector establishments offered apprenticeships, compared with 18% of private sector and 15% of voluntary sector establishments.

As shown in Figure 2-5, results suggest that employers facing skills challenges were more likely to use apprenticeships. For example, two-fifths (41%) of employers that had skill-shortage vacancies either currently employed apprentices or offered apprenticeships, compared with only one in six (17%) of those that did not have any skill-shortage vacancies. This is linked in part to size, in that a greater proportion of larger businesses, who were more likely to offer apprenticeships, were more likely to report having skill-shortage vacancies. In addition, employers with skill-shortage vacancies were more likely to offer apprenticeships than those with hard-to-fill vacancies with causes unrelated to skills issues (41% vs. 34%). The higher prevalence among those with skill-shortage vacancies suggests these employers recognise the value that apprenticeships provide in addressing skills issues. Similar differences were also evident between employers that reported skills gaps within their existing workforce (40%) and those who did not (15%).

## Reasons for offering apprenticeships

Understanding the motivations for offering apprenticeships can help shape the policy response and messaging around the promotion of the programmes to encourage more employers to consider taking on apprentices. Those employers that had started offering apprenticeships recently (in the last three years) were asked about the reasons they started doing so. Results are shown in Figure 2-6. As well as the individual reasons given, responses have been grouped into four broad themes: acquiring talent, altruistic reasons, nurturing talent and financial reasons.

A full list of the reasons that are included in each grouped set of reasons are included in Table B.1 in Appendix B.

The most common reasons for offering apprenticeships were to do with **acquiring talent**, both for the establishment and for the industry. Half (50%) of employers that had recently started offering apprenticeships reasons relating to this theme. This was broadly in line with 2016, although the proportion saying it was to ensure young people continue to enter their sector increased from 14% to 19%.

Approaching a quarter (23%) gave **altruistic reasons** for offering apprenticeships, in particular "to give young people a chance" (20%). This proportion showed no change since 2016.

A fifth (21%) started offering apprenticeships as a good way of **nurturing talent**, particularly that they are seen as a good way to upskill current staff (10%), but also because they can shape their own apprenticeship framework (4%) and train people to their own specific needs (3%). A handful mentioned a positive reaction from staff: 3% said they were responding to employee demand and 1% that they did it to increase morale and improve retention. These results were all broadly in line with figures seen in 2016.

**Financial reasons** were mentioned by just under one in ten employers (9%), down from 12% in 2016. The lower prevalence of financial reasons was predominantly due to a fall in the proportion of employers that said they had started offering apprenticeships because they are good value for money or cost effective (2%, compared with 8% in 2016) and in the proportion mentioning the availability of grants to support apprenticeship training (2% vs. 4%). The most common specific reason for starting to offer apprenticeships was because of the apprenticeship levy; this was mentioned by 6% of employers that had recently started offering apprenticeships. In contrast, in 2016 fewer than 1% mentioned starting to offer apprenticeships in anticipation of the apprenticeship levy being introduced.

There have been large changes in the motivations for starting to offer apprenticeships among establishments with 100 or more staff, away from **acquiring talent** and **altruistic reasons** to **financial reasons**. More specifically, the proportion saying it was because of the levy was 30% among these large employers (compared to 6% overall), up from 3% who mentioned anticipating the apprenticeship levy as a reason in 2016, which made it the joint-top reason for doing so, alongside being a good way to get skilled staff. Indeed, the apprenticeship levy was the top reason among employers with 250 or more staff by some distance, at 43%.

This suggests that the apprenticeship levy has acted to stimulate many larger employers to start offering apprenticeships in order to 'claim back' their levy payment. Table 2-1 shows the change in each motivating reason at the overall level and among establishments with 100 or more staff.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:30]

Three-fifths of establishments that started to offer apprenticeships in the last three years (61%) said the decision to start offering apprenticeships was one made internally with no outside influence. However, over a quarter (28%) had been approached by an external individual or agency and just over a fifth (22%) said this was the sole influence on their decision to offer apprenticeships (6% said it was "a bit of both"). The proportion that had been approached by an external agency about offering apprenticeships (28%) was much lower than in 2016 (38%).

Approaches by external individuals or agencies were more common among those that had recently started offering apprenticeships in Northern Ireland (48%). As seen previously, engagement with apprenticeships is lower in Northern Ireland than in England or Wales.

Among those that had been approached by an external organisation or individual, it was most common for this to have been a school or Further Education/sixth form college (33%, higher among employers in the private sector (35%) than the public sector (19%), the apprentice themselves (19%) or commercial providers (17%, far fewer than in 2016 when this type of organisation was the most common external influence mentioned (28%). Figure 2-7 shows the detailed list of organisation types approaching employers about offering apprenticeships.

**Figure 2-7 Proportion of establishments that were approached by external organisations or individuals when deciding to offer apprenticeships, and the types of organisations or individuals that made the approach**

## Reasons for not offering apprenticeships

Awareness of apprenticeships is high, with nearly all (98%) employers that did not offer them having at least heard of the term, and nine in ten (89%) saying that they had at least some knowledge of what they involve. Awareness was high across all sizes and sectors of employer.

Understanding the barriers employers face to offering apprenticeships is central to understanding how to increase uptake. As such, employers that were aware of apprenticeships but did not currently offer them were asked why this was. Results are shown in Figure 2-8. As well as the most common specific responses, answers have been categorised into three broad themes:

* Perceived barriers around the way apprenticeships are designed and structured;
* An active choice not to offer apprenticeships at the establishments;
* A lack of awareness of what is involved.

**Figure 2-8 Reasons for not offering apprenticeships (unprompted)**

A full list of the reasons that are included in each grouped set of reasons are included in Table B.2 in Appendix B.

Around three-fifths of establishments (62%) mentioned at least one structural barrier to them offering apprenticeships; rising to 66% among establishments with 2 to 4 staff. This was most commonly that apprenticeships are not suitable for their size of establishment (20%). This response was predominantly given by establishments with fewer than 25 staff; 25% of employers with 2-4 staff and 15% with 5-24 cited this as a reason compared with just 7% of employers with 25 or more staff.

Approaching a fifth (18%) of employers said they did not offer apprenticeships because they were not looking to recruit in general. This was more commonly mentioned by smaller establishments with 2 to 4 staff (22%).

Another common structural barrier was the perception that apprenticeships were not available for the establishment's industry (9%). This view was particularly prevalent in Wales (16%) and to a lesser extent Northern Ireland (11%), compared to just 8% in England. Sectors where employers not offering apprenticeships were more likely to say that the current apprenticeship offering was not geared towards them were Public Administration (16%), Transport and Storage (14%), Arts and Other Services (12%), Education and Health and Social Work (11%), though it is important to note, as discussed earlier in this chapter, that most of these sectors had a high prevalence of employers offering apprenticeships.

Some employers mentioned costs as a barrier, with 8% saying they could not currently afford to offer apprenticeships; this was a more common reason among smaller employers (9% of those with 2 to 4 staff, compared with 6% of those with 5 or more staff). It was also the second most common reason given by establishments in the Education sector (17%) and this sector was far more likely to give this response than any other sector.

A third of employers (32%) said they had made an active choice not to offer apprenticeships. This was mainly because their current staff already had all the skills required (13%). Again this reason was more common among small employers with 2 to 4 staff (15%). This response along with the relatively high proportion of employers saying they were not looking to recruit staff suggests employers could be open to the idea in the future should their situation change. Others said they preferred to recruit experienced staff (6%) suggesting that the messaging for them would need to be around the benefits of training an individual to their own specific needs or perhaps upskilling existing staff through apprenticeships.

One in ten employers (9%) gave reasons relating to a lack of awareness about apprenticeships, most commonly that they just had not considered it because they had not trained apprentices in the past (6%).

The top six reasons for not offering apprenticeships by country, size and sector can be seen in full in Appendix A, Table A.2.7.

## Number of apprentices

Among employers with apprentices at the time of the interview, the majority (60%) had just one apprentice at their site (60%), and nine in ten (90%) had four or fewer. In comparison 3% had 10 or more apprentices. These results suggest a slight increase compared with 2016, when a higher proportion had just one apprentice (65%). This could be partly to do with larger employers making up a larger proportion of the population of establishments offering apprentices, as discussed earlier in this chapter.

**Figure 2-9 Number of apprentices at each site that has current apprentices (banded), by size of establishment**

## Appendix A Appendices as a proportion of employees

Comparing the number of apprentices with the number of staff an establishment employs - "apprentice density" allows an assessment of the extent to which types of establishments are supporting the most apprentices compared to their size.18

Footnote 18: Note that all volumetric data covered in this section of the report reflect the number of _current apprentices_ reported at the time of interview at a local establishment level, across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Administrative data on apprenticeship _starts_ at enterprise level by academic year in England can be found here: DFE: _Apprenticeships in England by industry characteristics 2018 to 2019_.

Figure 2-10 shows two bars for each size of establishment. The shorter, dark blue bar shows the number of apprentices per 1,000 staff among all establishments in that size band. The longer, white bar shows the overall number of apprentices per 1,000 staff just among those employers that had current apprentices. Results show there were 47 apprentices for every 1,000 employees in establishments with apprentices, and 18 apprentices per 1,000 employees across the economy as a whole.19

Footnote 19: Note that all volumetric data covered in this section of the report reflect the number of _current apprentices_ reported at the time of interview at a local establishment level, across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Administrative data on apprenticeship _starts_ at enterprise level by academic year in England can be found here: DFE: _Apprenticeships in England by industry characteristics 2018 to 2019_.

Predictably, when looking just at employers with apprentices, the number of apprentices per 1,000 staff decreases with establishment size. This simply reflects that one apprentice in an establishment with 2-4 staff comprises at least a quarter of the workforce.

In comparison the density of apprentices per 1,000 staff among all employers varies much less by employer size, from 14 per 1,000 (in the 2-4 and 100-249 bands) to 21 per 1,000 (in the 5-24 and 250+ bands ).

**Figure 2-10 Number of current apprentices per 1,000 employees, by size of establishment**

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
20 This large increase in apprentice density broadly aligns with patterns seen in the latest administrative data on apprenticeship starts, which shows that the number of apprenticeship starts In England decreased between the 2015/16 and 2018/19 academic years among small (0-49) and medium (50-249) businesses and increased among large business (250+) Note these comparisons are only indicative and differences between the two data sources should be noted, as explained in Footnote 14. Source: DfE: _Apprenticeships in England by industry characteristics 2018 to 2019_. \\ \hline \end{tabular}

There were also considerable differences in the 2019 apprenticeship density figures by sector. The highest was in the Construction sector, which had 108 apprentices for every 1,000 employees among establishments that had apprentices, and 39 per 1,000 across the sector as a whole. Construction employers were more likely than average to have apprentices (15%, compared to 10% overall) and to be small establishments, meaning each apprentice accounts for a high proportion of staff at each site with apprentices.

Sectors with the highest proportion of establishments engaged with apprenticeships were not necessarily the ones with the highest density of apprentices, however. Whilst employers in Education were the most likely to have any apprentices at all (23%, compared to 10% average), for the most part these employers had fewer than 5 apprentices. As a result of this, combined with the larger size profile generally for this sector, the number of apprentices per 1,000 staff both for establishments with apprentices (30) and overall in the sector (12) was among the lowest of all the sectors. This was also seen in Public Administration, where 21% of employers had current apprentices (compared to 10% on average): the sector has just 36 apprentices per 1,000 employees among those with apprentices (compared to the all sector average of 47 per 1,000).

There were some large changes in apprentice density compared with 2016. Construction, despite having the highest apprentice density in 2019 saw the number of apprentices per 1,000 employees (among all employers) decrease from 46 in 2016 to 39 in 2019. There was also a large decrease within the Arts and Other Services sector (from 32 to 26). In contrast, several sectors saw their apprentice density increase, including Business Services (from 15 apprentices per 1,000 employees in 2016 to 23 in 2019) and Manufacturing (from 17 to 25).

\begin{table}

Two-thirds (65%) said levels have remained about the same, and 7% had decreased the number of apprentices they have since they first started offering (though rising to 12% in Wales).

The proportion saying the number had grown increased with employer size, from 11% of establishments with 2-4 staff up to 50% of those with 250 or more staff.

There were also differences by sector. Employers operating in the Information and Communications sector were the most likely to have increased numbers (45%; none reported a decrease); employers in Business services (32%) were also more likely than average to have seen an increase. On the other side of the coin, employers in Arts and Other Services and Construction were more likely than average to have decreased apprenticeship numbers since they first started offering them (18% and 13% respectively). Arts and Other Services was the only sector where more employers reported a decrease than an increase (18% vs. 14% respectively).

Figures were in line with those seen in 2016.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:39]

There was also significant variation by sector. Sectors where establishments were most likely to have retained any apprentices after their qualification was completed were Public Administration (87%), Financial Services (87%), Health and Social Work (76%) and Manufacturing (76%). Least likely to have done so were establishments in Information and Communications (54%) and Primary and Utilities (60%).

A full breakdown of the proportions retaining apprenticeship completers to permanent roles by establishment size and sector can be found in Appendix A, Table A.2.9.

Reasons for not retaining apprentices were varied, but in around half of cases (51%) it was the decision of the apprentice themselves rather than the employer. This was most often simply that the apprentices did not want to stay in their role (29%) or their apprentice had accepted a job at another employer (19%).

Around a quarter (27%) found that the apprentice(s) they did not retain were not right for the role, either in terms of their capability (16%) or being the right "fit" for the establishment (11%). One in twenty (5%) said the reason for not retaining them was that the apprentice had a poor attitude or lacked motivation.

One in ten employers (10%) said there was not enough work to keep their apprentices on as permanent staff and 3% found they could not afford to hire them permanently. These reasons were more common among large employers with 250 or more staff (22% and 14% respectively).

## 3 Routes into apprenticeships

### Chapter summary

The vast majority of establishments offering apprenticeships offer them to young people aged under 25 (88%) and a third (34%) exclusively offer them to this age group. Both of these results are lower than in 2016 (93% and 47% respectively). Employers in Wales (84%) and establishments with 2 to 4 employees (83%) were less likely than average to offer apprenticeships to young people.

Approaching three in five employers (57%) offer them to older workers aged 25 or over (2% solely offer them to this group), up from 48% in 2016. This proportion was higher among establishments in the Public Administration (87%), Health and Social Work (75%), Hotels and Restaurants (71%) and Education (70%) sectors.

The majority of employers offering apprenticeships offer them to new employees who they recruit specifically as apprentices (87%); approaching half (46%) only offer them to this group. Just over half (52%) offer apprenticeships to existing employees; one in ten (10%) offer them only to this group.

This proportion only offering apprenticeships to existing employees increased from 2016 levels (6%). Results show this was mainly driven by increases in provision of apprenticeships to existing employees among larger employers with 100 or more employees; rising from around half (54%) in 2016 to three-quarters (76%) in 2019. These are the establishments most likely to be affected by the apprenticeship levy.

Among employers that currently offer apprenticeships to new recruits, almost two-fifths (37%, equivalent to around a third (32%) of all employers offering apprenticeships) had used work experience placements to determine whether an individual would be suitable for an apprenticeship prior to recruiting them as an apprentice. This practice was less common among establishments with 100 or more staff (26% of those offering apprenticeships to new recruits) and establishments in Public Administration (7%) and Information and Communication (23%).

## Introduction

Whilst the main focus of apprenticeship policy has historically been to assist more young people into employment, apprenticeships are also available for those already employed who need to upskill and also for older people. This chapter looks at the proportion of employers offering apprenticeships to existing staff, the proportion recruiting people specifically as an apprentice, and the age groups they offer apprenticeships to.

## Age groups to which offer apprenticeships

Most establishments offering apprenticeships offer them to young people (88%) - for the purposes of this section "young people" is taken to mean anyone under the age of 25. A third (34%) offer apprenticeships exclusively to this age group.

The majority (57%) of establishments offering apprenticeships said they offer them to those aged 25 plus, although only 2% offer them to this age group exclusively.

The proportion offering apprenticeships to young people has decreased since 2016 from 93% to 88%, as has the proportion offering them exclusively to this group (from 47% to 34%). At the same time the proportion offering of apprenticeships to people aged 25 years or older has increased from 48% to 57%.

The proportion offering apprenticeships to young people was fairly consistent, although employers in Wales (84%) and establishments with 2 to 4 employees (83%) were less likely than average to do so.

There was larger variation in the proportions offering apprenticeships to people aged 25 or over. There were particular differences by sector, with the proportion higher among establishments in Public Administration (87%), Health and Social Work (75%), Hotels and Restaurants (71%) and Education (70%).

The full breakdown of age groups employers offer apprenticeships to by country, size and sector with comparisons to 2016 are presented in Appendix A, Table A.3.1.

## Apprenticeships for new recruits and/or existing employees

Apprenticeships, although often traditionally associated with recruitment of young people, are also applicable to existing members of staff. The majority of employers that offered apprenticeships (87%) offer them to new employees who they recruit specifically as apprentices, and nearly half (46%) offer apprenticeships _only_ to this group (i.e. they do not also offer them to existing staff).

A slight majority of employers offering apprenticeships (52%) do so to existing employees, with one in ten (10%) offering apprenticeships _only_ to this group. This was most common among large establishments, with 100 or more staff.

Figure 3-1 shows that the proportion of employers offering apprenticeships only to new recruits decreases with establishment size: as many as 60% of employers with 2-4 staff offer them only to new recruits, compared with just under a quarter among those with 100 or more staff (23%).

**Figure 3-1 Whether employers offer apprenticeships to new recruits, existing employees or both over time, and by size in 2019**

A full breakdown by country, size and sector can be seen in Appendix A, Table A.3.2.

Whilst overall the proportion offering apprenticeships to existing staff has remained consistent over time, as Figure 3-1 shows, the proportion of employers offering them _only_ to existing staff has increased since 2016, from 6% to 10%. This is a result of changes among large employers, particularly those with 100 or more staff: having been fairly steady from 2014 to 2016, the proportion of these establishments offering apprenticeships to existing staff has increased from around a half to around three-quarters in 2019.

These are the establishments most likely to be affected by the apprenticeship levy. Findings discussed earlier on the reasons for starting to offer apprenticeships showed that large employers that were new to offering apprenticeships were particularly likely to say the apprenticeship levy was their reason for doing so (43%). This suggests that in order to get best use from their levy payments, employers are increasing the number of existing employees they offer apprenticeships to, and aligns with qualitative work undertaken prior to the introduction to the levy that suggested this would be one of a range of responses by employers to the levy (Gambin et al., 2016).21

## Use of work placements to check suitability of prospective apprentices

Among employers that currently offer apprenticeships to new recruits, almost two-fifths (37%, equivalent to around a third (32%) of all employers offering apprenticeships) had used work experience placements in the past to determine whether an individual would be suitable for an apprenticeship prior to recruiting them as an apprentice.

The practice was more common in Wales (44% of those offering apprenticeships to new recruits) and in establishments in the Arts and Other Services (51%) and Education (44%) sectors. It was very uncommon in establishments with 100 or more staff (26%) and establishments in Public Administration (7%) and Information and Communication (23%).

A full breakdown by country, size and sector can be seen in Appendix A, Table A.3.3.

## 4 Awareness and provision of trainees in England and Wales

The Governments of both England and Wales have traineeship schemes designed to improve employability among young people. The schemes are separate from each other, so are reported separately below.

### England

Government traineeships in England have three key components: providing work experience opportunities to young individuals, supporting them with basic skills such as Maths and English, and offering work preparation training. Through a traineeship, young people can gain the skills and experience that employers are looking for. They last a maximum of six months and have been open to 16- to 24-year-olds since 2013.22

Footnote 22: More information on traineeships in England is available here:

[https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/raineeships-programme#traineeships:-overview-for-young-people](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/raineeships-programme#traineeships:-overview-for-young-people)

In England, approaching half of employers (45%) were aware of traineeships. A fifth (20%) were aware of them in name only and did not know what they were, a similar proportion (19%) were aware with some knowledge, and 6% said they had a good knowledge of them and what they involve.

The overall level of awareness was slightly lower than it was in 2016, when 48% were aware of traineeships. That said, those reporting at least some knowledge has increased (from 24% to 26%), as has the proportion claiming to have "a good knowledge" of traineeships (from 4% to 6%).

**Figure 4-1 Awareness of trainees in England**

Overall, 3% of establishments in England had had anyone undertake a traineeship in the previous 12 months (rising to 7% in the Education sector). This is an increase on the 1% that had done so in 2016.

Larger employers with 100 or more staff were more likely to be aware of traineeships (50%) and more likely to have any knowledge about them (23% said they had "some knowledge" and 11% "good knowledge" compared to 19% and 6% overall). They were also more likely to have had someone undertake a traineeship with them (7%, compared to 3% overall).

Further subgroup differences can be seen in Appendix A, Table A.4.1.

## Wales

Traineeships are for young people aged 16-18 in Wales not engaged in post-16 education or employment. The primary objective of the programme is to equip people with the skills, qualifications and experience to enable them to progress to further learning or to employment, including an Apprenticeship. Traineeships have three different levels to make sure that young people get the support and backing they need to progress: Engagement; Level 1; and Level 2 - Bridge to Employment. The engagementstrand of the programme is open to young people who need additional support to help them engage or overcome barriers to engagement.

In Wales, just over a quarter of employers (28%) said they had heard of the traineeship programme in Wales, and 2% had taken someone on as part of the traineeship programme. Subgroup differences are shown in Appendix A, Table A.4.2, although due to the small base sizes involved few reach statistical significance.

Lack of awareness (75%) was the stand out reason why employers in Wales had not taken someone on to do a traineeship. Other reasons mentioned included not having suitable roles (8%); traineeships not being suitable due to the size of the establishment (5%) and not having the time or resources to manage the process (3%).

Those who had taken on someone to do a traineeship most commonly said they did this to give someone a chance (60%). A quarter (26%) said that they provided traineeships to test whether individuals were suitable for a permanent job, while 10% or fewer gave reasons including using traineeships as a means of testing whether individuals were suitable for an apprenticeship (10%); being asked or approached by a student or school (9%); and having funding available for training (4%).23

## 5 Awareness and impacts of the apprenticeship policy reforms

### Chapter summary

Approaching two-fifths (37%) of all employers were aware of the introduction of the apprenticeship levy. Awareness of the levy was far higher among larger employers: sites with 100 or more staff were more than twice as likely as average to be aware of the levy as those with 2-4 staff (77% compared to 33%). There was wide variation by sector, with awareness levels highest in Education and Public Administration (66% and 52% respectively) and lowest in Hotels and Restaurants (27%); Wholesale and Retail (29%) and the Primary Sector and Utilities (32%).

In terms of details, approaching six in ten of those that had heard of the apprenticeship levy (58%, equivalent to 21% of all employers) were aware that it applies to employers with a wage bill of PS3m or higher, and more than half (52%, equivalent to 19% of all employers) were aware the amount levied was 0.5% of the annual wage bill.

Within England (where the funding approach is based on employers being able to 'claim back' the levy), among those that had heard of the levy, more than two-thirds (68%, equivalent to 26% of all employers) were aware the levy money can be used to offset apprenticeship costs. There was less awareness in England of the requirement for employers to contribute 5% to the cost of an apprenticeship (27% of those aware of apprenticeships); that training providers receive a premium for recruiting apprentices from deprived areas (22%); and that a minimum of 20% of an apprentice's paid hours must be allocated to off-the-job training (35%).

Just under a quarter (23%) of employers that were aware of any of the recent reforms and that currently offered apprenticeships said these had led to a change in their apprenticeship offering; most commonly, the proportion of apprenticeship starts undertaken by existing employees since May 2017 (14%) and changes to the overall number of apprentices at the site (12%). In both cases, the impact was more often an increase than a decrease.

## Introduction

As highlighted earlier in the report, major reforms in the way apprenticeships are funded and delivered came into effect in April 2017. While the exact approach to funding and delivery of apprenticeships differs between countries, all UK employers with a wage bill of E3m or more are required to pay a levy payment, totalling 0.5% of their wage bill. Employers in England can claim this back to fund their own apprenticeship training should they wish to; the funds last 24 months from when they are credited to an employer's account. So for employers in England money from the first payments in April 2017 expired in April 2019 just before fieldwork for ESS 2019. In Wales, the Welsh Government fund the training costs of apprenticeships, and in Northern Ireland the directed (or 'off-the-job') training element is funded by the Department for the Economy with support from the Northern Ireland European Social Fund Programme 2014-2020.24

Footnote 24: Nibusinessinfo.co.uk, _Finances and funding for Apprenticeships_ [accessed April 2020]

Employers in England, whether they eligible for the levy or not, now have to contribute 5% towards the cost of an apprenticeship. There is also a minimum set number of hours the apprentices in England must spend completing off-the-job training, and training providers in England are incentivised to recruit apprentices from deprived areas.

The questions around awareness of recent policy changes presented in this chapter were asked only of employers in England and Wales. Employers in England were asked additional follow-up questions on some of the finer details of the policy reforms that impact specifically in England-only.

## Awareness of recent policy changes

Employers in England and Wales that were aware of apprenticeships were asked whether they were aware of each of the key elements of the apprenticeship reforms of 2017.

Approaching two-fifths (37%) of all employers were aware of the introduction of the apprenticeship levy. Awareness of the levy among large employers, i.e. the group it is most likely to apply to, was far higher: sites with 100 or more staff were more than twice as likely than average to be aware of the levy than those with 2-4 staff (77% compared to 33%). Figure 5-1 shows awareness of the apprenticeship levy by size.

Employers in Wales were less aware of the introduction of the apprenticeship levy (30% of those aware of apprenticeships) than those in England (38%). Awareness also varied by sector, with awareness higher in Education (66%), Public Administration (52%), Business Services (42%), Health and Social Work (41%) and Manufacturing (40%). Conversely awareness was lower than average in Hotels and Restaurants (27%), Wholesale and Retail (29%) and the Primary Sector and Utilities (32%).

Across England and Wales, awareness of the details of the levy payment _among those that had heard of it_ were mixed:

* Just under six in ten were aware that it applies to employers with a wage bill of E3m or higher (58%, equivalent to 21% of all employers); and
* Just over half were aware the amount levied was 0.5% of the wage bill (52%, equivalent to 19% of all employers);

Within England, where the funding approach is based on employers 'claiming back' their levy, among those that had heard of the levy just over two-thirds of employers (68%) were aware the levy money can be used to offset an employer's own apprenticeship costs (equivalent to 26% of all employers in England).

Large employers were more likely to be aware of the details of the apprenticeship levy (who it applies to, the levy amount and that it can be claimed back), with nearly all employers with 100 or more staff who were aware of the levy saying they knew of these details (Figure 5-2).

**Figure 5-2 Awareness of the details of the apprenticeship levy among employers aware of the levy**

In England, where there is also a requirement to contribute 5% to the cost of an apprenticeship, awareness of this requirement was lower than awareness of the levy, despite it applying to more employers. Just over a quarter (27%) of those aware of apprenticeships were aware that they needed to contribute 5% of costs, though this was much higher among those with 25 or more staff (47%) and those in Education (50%).

Within England, an additional policy reform was that training providers receive a premium for recruiting apprentices from deprived areas. Fewer than a quarter of those aware of apprenticeships were aware of this (22%); and this was the reform with the lowest level of awareness. Finally, over a third (35%) knew that a minimum of 20% of the apprentices' paid hours needed to be allocated to off-the-job training.

Figure 5-3 shows that awareness was far higher among larger establishments, despite these elements of the reforms being relevant to all employers.

**Figure 5-3 Awareness of other reforms affecting England only among employers aware of apprenticeships, by establishment size**

There was also considerable variation by sector. Table A.5.4 in Appendix A shows the full details of subgroup differences to these questions but in summary:

* Awareness in the Primary sector & Utilities and the Wholesale and Retail sector was consistently lower than average; and
* Awareness was consistently higher than average in the Education, Health and Social Work, Public Administration, and Arts and Other sectors.

These results are, in part, due to differences in the size profile of these sectors. For instance, IBR population data shows that in England, the Education (56%), Public Administration (60%) and Health and Social Work (79%) sectors had the lowest proportion of sites with fewer than 25 employees (this compares with 90% across the UK business population); it is these smaller establishments where awareness was particularly low. However, these sector differences cannot be solely attributed to establishment size; for example, despite high levels of awareness in the Arts and Other sector, it has a relatively high proportion of establishments with fewer than 25 employees (94%).

## Impact of the apprenticeship reforms to date

Employers were asked whether the apprenticeship reforms to date had impacted on their apprenticeship offering. Overall just under a quarter (23%) of employers that were aware of any of the recent apprenticeship reforms and currently offered apprenticeships said there had been changes in the apprenticeship offering at the site. This was most commonly changes to the **proportion of apprenticeship starts that have been undertaken by existing employees** since May 2017 (14% of employers in England that offered apprenticeships and were aware of the apprenticeship reforms), and **changes to the overall number of apprentices** at the site (12%).

As Figure 5-4 shows, the impact on **overall apprenticeship numbers** tended to be employers increasing numbers, with 6% having increased their apprenticeship numbers and 1% starting to offer apprenticeships as a result of the reforms.25 These changes were far more common among large employers, with 23% of those with 100 or more staff having increased their numbers and 3% having started offering apprenticeships. The recent Apprenticeships Evaluation Employer Survey (2018-19) asked similar questions in relation to the apprenticeship reforms and its impacts. ESS 2019 found a greater proportion of employers in England reporting 'no change' in apprenticeships as a result of the reforms (83% of those aware of any of the reforms that offered apprenticeships vs. 76% in the Apprenticeships Evaluation Survey) and hence fewer reporting increases in apprenticeship numbers (7% vs. 13%) or decreases (3% vs. 7%). Overall though the 'net' change (the proportion reporting an increase minus those reporting a decrease) was very similar across the two surveys.26

Footnote 25: DFE, _Apprenticeship evaluation 2018 to 2019: employer survey, p.123_ (2020). Note, the Apprenticeship Evaluation included only employers that had recently had individuals complete an apprenticeship (between 1st February and 30th September 2017). In contrast, the Employer Skills Survey is a representative sample of all employers. As a result, caution should be applied when comparing result between the two studies.

Among those employers that had changed whether **apprenticeships were offered to existing staff**, more commonly establishments reported they had either started offering (1%) or had increased offering (5%) to existing staff than they had decreased or stopped; again the changes were most notable among large employers (among those with 100 or more staff 4% had started, and 17% had increased the proportion of apprenticeships offered to existing staff).

Fewer had changed the **number of managers starting apprenticeships** (7%) or the number of apprenticeship **starts in subjects relating to activities outside of the establishments core business** (8%); figures here are based on employers in England that offered apprenticeships and were aware of the apprenticeship reforms.

## 6 Future engagement in apprenticeships

Chapter summary

Although plans are likely to have been heavily affected by Covid-19, data collected prior to the pandemic indicated potential growth in apprenticeships. Three in ten (30%) establishments had planned to offer apprenticeships in the future, compared with 18% that offer them currently. The vast majority (87%) of those that already offered apprenticeships planned to continue doing so, while a fifth (18%) of those that did not offer apprenticeships planned to start offering them. Results are similar to those reported historically, showing that employer intentions to offer apprenticeships do not always materialise.

Large employers offering apprenticeships were particularly likely to have planned to continue offering apprenticeships (96% of sites with 100 plus staff, though even among those with 2 to 4 staff the figure was 81%). Large employers not offering apprenticeships currently were also more likely than smaller employers to start offering apprenticeships (38% of employers with 100 or more staff, compared with 15% of those with 2 to 4 staff). Employers in the Education sector were most likely to intend to offer apprenticeships in the future; 92% of those currently offering them planned to continue doing so, and 27% of those that did not offer them planned to start.

Employers that had planned to start offering apprenticeship most commonly mentioned reasons relating to acquiring talent (62%), including apprenticeships being a good way to get skilled staff (33%) and ensuring young people continued to enter the industry (22%). A fifth (20%) mentioned altruistic reasons, in particular seeing them as a good way to give young people a chance (17%).

The main reasons why employers planned to stop offering apprenticeships included them not looking to recruit new staff (41%), not being able to afford apprentices (17%) and apprenticeships not being suitable due to the size of their establishment (14%, up from 6% in 2016). A fifth (20%) were actively choosing to stop, for instance, because past apprentices were of a poor standard (10%), while 7% of those planning to stop said this was due to recent reforms.

Among employers that offered apprenticeships and planned to continue doing so, three in ten (30%) expected numbers to increase in the next two years, mainly due to expectations that their business would grow (39%). Just 4% expected apprenticeship numbers to decrease, although these plans could change in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

## Introduction

So far, this report has explored the current market for apprenticeships. This chapter looks at what the demand might be for the future by asking employers their plans for offering apprenticeships in the future. This includes whether they intend to begin offering apprenticeships, stop offering apprenticeships and any expected changes to the numbers of apprentices they employ over the next two years. This section also explores employers' reasons for these anticipated changes.

Given that survey fieldwork took place some months prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, results that present a picture of employers' future intentions in relation to apprenticeships are likely to have changed radically. Caution should therefore be taken in interpreting these findings. However, the results provide a useful picture of how future intentions at the time had changed compared with 2016 and provide a pre-Covid-19 baseline on which to compare future survey findings.

## Future demand for Apprenticeships

Overall, 30% of all establishments reported at the time they were interviewed that they planned to offer apprenticeships in the future. Of those that had apprenticeships or offered them, the majority (87%) planned to continue doing so, while approaching a fifth (18%) of those that were not currently offering apprenticeships reported that they planned to do so in the future. This was in line with figures seen in 2016.

**Figure 6-1 Future plans for apprenticeship offerings**Large employers offering apprenticeships were particularly likely to have planned to continue offering apprenticeships (96% of sites with 100 plus staff, though even among those with 2-4 staff the figure was 81%), as were employers in the Education (92%), Health and Social Work (90%) and Business Services (90%) sectors. Employers in the Construction sector were the least likely to have planned to continue their involvement in apprenticeships (80%).

Among those not offering apprenticeships it was again the larger employers that were most likely to say they planned to do so in future (38% of employers with 100 or more staff compared with 15% of those with fewer than 5 staff). Employers not offering apprenticeships in the Education (27%) and the Information and Communications (24%) sectors were most likely to have planned to do so in future.

Another key factor was whether employers had offered apprenticeships at all in the last three years. Among those that had, but did not offer them at the time of interview, nearly half (46%) planned to do so again in future, compared with just 15% of employers that had not offered apprenticeships at all in the last three years. This may suggest that those that had recent experiences of offering apprenticeships had generally positive experiences but did not routinely need apprentices.

It is also important to understand the 6% of employers that offered apprenticeships but planned to stop doing so. This group were predominantly small establishments (92% were establishments with fewer than 25 employees, compared with 73% among those that planned to continue offering apprenticeships). This could again indicate that these businesses use apprenticeships on an infrequent basis and had no need to take on another apprentice in the immediate future. This is borne out in the main reasons given for planning to stop offering apprenticeships, such as not looking to recruit staff (covered in the next section). The proportion that offered apprenticeships but planned to stop doing so was particularly high among establishments with 2 to 4 employees (10%) and the Construction sector (16%).

It is known from previous editions of the Employer Perspectives Survey series that employers' stated intentions for offering apprenticeships in the future do not necessarily materialise, at least not to their fullest extent. In each Employer Perspectives Survey iteration since 2012 around a third of all establishments reported that they were planning to offer apprenticeships in the future, yet, as reported at the start of this chapter, the proportion of establishments offering apprenticeships in 2019 is just 18% (and the proportion offering apprenticeships has not changed markedly over the 2012-2019 period).

The 30% of employers this year stating that they planned to offer apprenticeships in future is very similar to the third of establishments saying the same in 2012, 2014 and 2016, therefore, taking out Covid-19 factors, overall there were no signs of significant growth in terms of the proportion of employers investing in apprenticeships.

Nevertheless, the EPS data on employer intentions to offer apprenticeships in future establishes the _market potential_ for employer engagement with apprenticeships and identifies the types of establishment most positively predisposed towards apprenticeships. We look at the extent of potential growth among those involved in the sections below.

Full size and sector breakdowns can be found in Appendix A, Table A.6.1, and an indication of the volume of establishments this affects in Table A.6.2.

### Reasons for planning to enter or exit the apprenticeships market

Earlier in this report we explored the reasons establishments that were relatively new to offering apprenticeships had started offering apprenticeships, and reasons other establishments were not currently engaged in apprenticeships. This section looks at the reasons why establishments planned to enter or exit the apprenticeship market to gain a deeper understanding of the drivers and barriers to engaging with apprenticeships. As was mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, these results reflect employer positions prior to the outbreak of Covid-19, which are likely to substantially impact apprenticeship and wider recruitment plans.

Recruitment was first and foremost in many minds of employers planning to start offering apprenticeships. A third (33%) saw apprenticeships as a good way to get skilled staff, a fifth recognised that they help ensure young people continue to enter the company or industry (22%) and a similar proportion said they were looking to expand their business (19%). Overall just over three-fifths (62%) gave reasons related to the need to acquire new talent (62%).

Altruistic reasons were also fairly common, with a fifth (20%) mentioning a reason related to helping young people into work or helping the community.

Around one in six (17%) mentioned reasons relating to the potential for apprenticeships to nurture their existing talent, for example wanting to upskill current staff, the potential for shaping their own framework and training people to their specific needs.

The apprenticeship levy was mentioned by very few (1%), although this rose to 10% among establishments with 100 or more staff. This equates to around 3,600 employers in total that were planning to start apprenticeships in part due to the introduction of the apprenticeship levy, lower than the volume (c. 5,100) that said they have already started offering apprenticeships in response to the levy introduction, suggesting most who wanted to take action off the back of these changes have already done so.

Results are shown in Figure 6-2. The hierarchy of reasons as well as the overall figures are very similar to those seen in 2016.

**Figure 6-2 Reasons for planning to start offering apprenticeships in future (unprompted)**

On the other side of the coin are the employers that offered apprenticeships, but had planned to stop doing so in future. Results are shown in Figure 6-3.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:62]

The reasons for planning to stop offering apprenticeships were very similar to those given in 2016. The one exception is an increase in the proportion saying apprenticeships are not suitable due to the size of the business (from 6% to 14% in 2019). This finding accompanies results which show a reduction in apprenticeship uptake among the smallest establishments with 2 to 4 employees and an increase among larger establishments (see Chapter 2).

## Expected change in apprentice numbers

We have discussed how 30% of establishments expected, at the time of the survey, to offer apprenticeships in future. Whilst around half of these (14% of all employers) would have been new entrants to the apprenticeship market, the other half (16% of all employers) already had apprentices or offered apprenticeships. This section briefly explores which groups of employers were most likely to expect apprentice numbers to increase at the time of interview. While the picture is likely to change as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, exploring variations by subgroup and historical comparisons may provide some indication of which employer groups have the greatest appetite to increase their use of apprenticeships.

Among employers that offered apprenticeships and planned to continue doing so, three in ten (30%) expected the number of apprentices at their site to increase in the next two years, compared with 4% that expected it to decrease. The majority, approaching two-thirds (64%), expected the number to remain about the same. These results have not changed from those reported in 2016.

Larger employers were much more likely to have expected numbers to increase than smaller employers (64% of those with 250 or more staff compared with 19% of those with 2-4 staff). There were also differences by sector. Expectations that apprentice numbers would increase at the time of interview were most common among establishments in the Hotels and Restaurants (50%) and Public Administration (46%) sectors, while employers in Education (19%) and Construction (23%) sectors were less likely than average to have expected an increase, matching patterns reported in 2016.

The overall proportion in 2019 that expected to see an increase in apprenticeship numbers was the same, at 30%, as it was in 2016. However, there have been changes in how employers of different sizes expected their apprenticeship numbers to change in future. Table 6-1 shows that whilst large employers were equally likely to have expected apprenticeship numbers to increase, small employers with 2 to 4 staff were far less likely to.

## 6 Reasons for expected change in apprentices numbers

The most common reason for expecting an increase in apprenticeship numbers was business growth, mentioned by 39% of establishments (rising to 44% of smaller firms with fewer than 50 staff; in comparison it was a factor for 28% of those with 50 or more staff). Around one in six (16%) said they were seeing higher demand for apprenticeship positions, and a similar proportion (15%) said good experiences of apprenticeships so far made them want to expand their offer.

Whilst just 5% overall mentioned the apprenticeship levy as a reason for planning to increase the number of apprentices they had, this increased to 16% of employers with 100 or more staff suggesting they are looking to maximise the return on the levy payment towards their own apprenticeship costs.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline  & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{\% operating number of apprentices to increase} \\ \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Edge} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{2016} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{2016} \\  & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{2016/2016} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{2016} \\ \hline  & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\%} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\%} \\ \hline  & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{2,003/2,358} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{30} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{30} \\ \hline \hline

\end{table}
Table 6-1: Expectations that the number of apprentices at the site will increase, by size of establishment, comparing 2016 and 2019Employers that were not expecting any change in their apprenticeship numbers most commonly said this was because they were happy with what they were offering at the moment and they had no business need to change it (34%). Second most common was that they were not looking to recruit new staff (14%), showing that many businesses still associate apprenticeships primarily with new recruits. Similarly, 12% said it was because of a lack of business growth; this was particularly common among establishments with fewer than 5 staff (20%). Around one in ten (9%) said they could not currently afford to increase numbers and the same proportion said they did not have the resources for more apprentices. The reasons for expecting numbers to remain constant were similar to those given in 2016.

Reasons for expecting a decrease in apprenticeship numbers were tied largely to recruitment, with 29% saying they were not looking to recruit new staff so would not be taking on any more apprentices. Around one in five (18%) said there was just not the demand for apprenticeship positions and one in six (16%) that their staff were all fully skilled so they had no need to put them on apprenticeship programmes. One in eight (12%) said they could not afford to continue their apprenticeship programme. In 2016 current staff being fully skilled had been the top reason (given at 41%). While this is a significant decrease, the small base size at this question should be noted (81 employers in 2019 and 70 in 2016).

## Conclusions

The Employer Skills Survey 2019 gives a first look at the initial impact of the apprenticeship funding reforms that came into effect in 2017. At the time of the survey the reforms had had 2 years to bed in, and employers in England that had paid the levy were approaching the point at which the first payments would expire if un-used (i.e. they would go to the government and no longer be available for the employer to use).

Whilst the overall proportion of establishments offering apprenticeships remained consistent between 2016 and 2019, the profile of employers offering them changed substantially. Smaller establishments became slightly less likely to offer them than in 2016; as in previous years this was mainly because they didn't feel apprenticeships were suitable for their size of establishment but this group were also more likely to cite cost as a barrier than larger establishments.

The big change however was among larger establishments. Survey data shows that four-in-five establishments with 250 or more staff now offer apprenticeships, up from three-in-five in 2016, and there has also been a significant increase among those with 100-249 staff. Additionally, there has been a substantial rise in the number of apprentices as a proportion of the total number of staff in establishments with 250 or more staff. It is clear that more of these employers are offering apprenticeships, and to more people.

Employers in these size bands are, of course, the ones most likely to be paying the levy. Some establishments in the smaller size bands will be levy payers by virtue of either having highly paid staff or being part of a larger organisation that qualifies, but among these top two size bands the majority will be doing so, particularly among the 250+ size band.

Reasons for offering apprenticeships have historically centred on it being a good way to recruit skilled staff, and altruistic reasons such as giving young people a chance. Employers in these largest size bands that have started offering apprenticeships in the last 3 years (i.e. since details of the levy were announced), however, break this pattern. The levy is now the key motivator for this group, and there has been an equivalent fall in the proportion stating reasons relating to acquiring talent or altruism.

Still more of the largest employers expect to either start offering apprenticeships or expect to increase numbers as a result of the levy, but these numbers are small suggesting most who will take action have already done so.

A lot of this increase seems to have been in the form of employers offering apprenticeships to existing staff - the proportion doing so is up nearly 50% among large employers. It looks probable that employers are using their apprenticeship levy money to give skills and qualifications to current staff rather than because they think that apprenticeships are the best option for their staff or new recruits. It will also be key to examine in future work whether they are offering this as additional training or using it to replace other forms of training, we report in the core report that many of the measures of training have reduced between 2017 to 2019.

Awareness of the reforms is reasonably high for such a new initiative suggesting the message is permeating, and the reforms have had some impact on nearly a quarter of employers aware of them that currently offer apprenticeships, most commonly in the form of increasing their offering to existing employees in increasing their overall numbers.

Future potential for apprenticeships appears strong. Most employers that offered them at the time of the survey intended to continue to do so, and nearly a fifth of those that didn't were considering it. Stated intentions, of course, do not always materialise into action, furthermore Covid-19 is already having a detrimental impact on the number of apprenticeship starts.27 Nevertheless, it is useful to know the potential market of those who would consider apprenticeships when the situation and timing is right for them.

## Appendix C: Industry coding

Each establishment was allocated to one of 13 sectors, based on their Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). SIC 2007 was used to classify establishments using the following method. Using the four-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) supplied for each record from the Market Location or IDBR database, a description of business activity was read out to each respondent. If they agreed that this description matched the main activity undertaken at the establishment, then the SIC on Market Location's database or IDBR was assumed to be correct. If, however, the respondent felt the description did not correspond to their main business activity at the site (around a fifth of cases), a verbatim response was collected to find out what they do. At the analysis stage this was coded to a four-digit SIC which was then used as the basis for allocation into sector.

The table below shows the 13 sectors and their corresponding SIC 2007 definitions.28
