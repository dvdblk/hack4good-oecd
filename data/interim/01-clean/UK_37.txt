1. Context and rationale
Innovation is a catalyst for growth, prosperity, and wellbeing and is at the core of Government
economic policy. The 2020 R&D Roadmap argued that fueling an efficient system of innovation will
“improve lives, services and businesses right around the UK and beyond – creating a fairer, healthier,
more prosperous and more resilient society” (HM Government 2021, 5). The Innovation Strategy
(BEIS 2021a, 7) states that encouraging innovation in the private sector is “an essential part of the
UK’s future prosperity and key to achieving UK objectives to be a force for good on global challenges
around climate, biodiversity, prosperity and security”. An expanding library of policy documents have
been produced to outline the Government's role in supporting the translation of these ambitions into
practice.
These documents all highlight the importance of attracting and supporting people as vectors of
innovation. The Innovation Strategy aims to make the UK “the most exciting place for innovation
talent” (BEIS 2021a, 52). The Innovate UK Strategic Delivery Plan includes “innovation talent and skills”
as one of the elements of its strong foundations and prioritises people and careers as one of its
strategic objectives (Innovate UK 2022, 6-7). The BEIS R&D People and Culture Strategy (BEIS 2021b)
specifically focuses on the role of people, arguing that they are at the core of R&D and that there is
nothing more important than attracting, developing, and retaining enough people to meet ambitions
around innovation.
Notably, many of these initiatives make reference to enhancing a set of leadership, management,
commercialisation, and entrepreneurial skills that contribute to innovation, commercialisation,
innovation adoption, and innovative business growth. These have been broadly labelled “innovation
skills”. However, what innovation skills actually are in practice has not been clearly defined. In response
to this challenge, Innovate UK partnered with the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical
Education (IfATE) to develop an evidence base and understanding of innovation skills to influence its
programmes and qualifications. The Innovation Caucus was commissioned to develop an Innovation
Skills Framework to identify the skills critical for innovation, support the development of an innovative
workforce, encourage the next generation of entrepreneurs and innovators to drive economic growth,
and support the UK’s position as a leader in innovation. As part of this process, we worked closely
with Innovate UK, IfATE, and their stakeholders to develop, test, and refine the Framework.
This report summarises the logic and components of the Framework and proposes some scenarios
for applying it within a wide variety of organisations and innovation contexts. We wrote this document
with both policy and practitioner audiences in mind. While the Framework itself will be of primary
interest to both, Section 2 provides important background on how we conceptualise innovation,
where it happens within organisations, and how we define innovation skills. An important part of this
section outlines how we connect innovation skills to tasks in order to better understand what skills
1
[Page #4]
contribute to each part of the innovation process. As we developed the Framework, presented in
detail in Section 3, we consulted closely with organisations from IfATE Route Panels, businesses
involved in Innovate UK programmes, and the policy community to get feedback on how well our
approach was aligning with how stakeholders think about innovation and skills and to learn how they
might apply the final product. These interactions led us to include Section 4 in which we outline a
selection of ways that this Framework can be used within organisations to enhance their innovation
skills profiles. The Framework was designed to be flexible and highly adaptable, and so these scenarios
represent just some of the ways that it can be translated into practice across a variety of contexts.
Future work will focus on lessons learned from implementing the Framework and on refining both the
Framework itself and the adoption process.
2. Our approach to innovation and skills
2.1 What is innovation?
For the purpose of this framework, we have adopted a very broad definition of innovation. We opted
for this expansive approach to ensure that the Framework would be applicable across the widest
possible range of contexts. The UK Innovation Survey (BEIS 2021c), adapting its definition from OECD
Oslo Manual, lists the following as examples of innovation:
● The introduction of a new or significantly improved product (good or service) or process
● Engagement in innovation projects not yet complete, scaled back, or abandoned
● New and significantly improved forms of organisation, businesses structures or practices, and
marketing concepts or strategies
●
Investment activities in areas such as internal research and development, training, acquisition of
external knowledge or machinery and equipment linked to innovation activities
As this definition makes plain, innovation can happen in any part of an organisation, from the product
or service offering (the output itself), to ways of producing output (production processes), to ways of
organising (such as business models).
The innovation process
In developing the Framework, we focused on innovation, and the skills required to execute, at the
organisation level, although we aimed to understand the innovation process and design a Framework
relevant to organisations across different sectors and of different sizes, from very small to very large.
Through an extensive review of the literature, we distilled the most commonly cited stages of the
innovation process: prospecting, ideating, selecting, and implementing. Prospecting involves gaining
an understanding of the domain and problems, organisational, market, and/or customer needs.
Ideating is the process of coming up with potential solutions. In the selecting phase, innovators
2
[Page #5]
evaluate and choose between high potential solutions against feasibility, practicality, market
acceptance, market size, costs, fit with internal resources and capabilities or other criteria. Finally, the
implementation phase involves turning those ideas into reality. Crucially, while this process is often
discussed in very linear terms, where the expectation is that innovation occurs across the neatly
delineated stages in order from prospecting to implementation, we acknowledge that the reality is
much more complex and dynamic. This is reflected in the way we depict the process in the background
of Figure 1 (page 4) as a series of interlocking rings.
Who are the innovators?
From our perspective, every organisation in the economy - public, private or third sector; large or
small; across all industries - relies on some form of innovation to evolve, grow and respond to the
changing environment. Every organisation is capable of innovation. We have structured this framework
with the assumption that innovation can originate from anywhere in an organisation and is not
necessarily tied to specific roles, occupations, or technical qualification categories.
2.2 Defining innovation skills
The term “skill” is often confused, misused, or used interchangeably with a variety of other concepts,
including talents, behaviours, knowledge, tasks, traits, values, and outcomes. IfATE (n.d.) recognises
this tendency and clearly distinguishes between knowledge (technical ‘know how’ needed to carry out
duties), behaviours (mindsets, attitudes, or approaches needed for competence), and skills (the
practical application of knowledge needed to carry out duties) in its standards development processes.
We build off this model and particularly focus on disentangling and identifying the relationships
between skills and tasks.
The tasks-skills nexus
In this framework, we define skills as the socially determined personal capacities that can add value
(to a process, organisation, or endeavour) and can be enhanced or developed through learning and
development. Tasks, by contrast, are the discrete but connected pieces of work that need to be
undertaken as part of the innovation process. In other words, skills are the capacities required to
complete tasks.
By approaching the innovation process as a series of tasks and then considering what skills are
necessary to complete them, we open up the possibility that specific tasks may require the application
of multiple skills to accomplish and that certain skills can enhance one’s capacity to complete several
different tasks. We also argue that disentangling tasks from skills enables organisations to more
effectively map the elements of work that go into their own innovation processes to more accurately
identify and pair them with relevant skill sets for evaluation, development, or selection/recruitment
purposes.

[Page #6]
Figure 1: Innovation phases, tasks, and levels
Innovation skills
Innovation skills are those socially determined personal capacities that can add value (to a process,
organisation, or endeavour) and can be enhanced or developed through learning and development
that contribute to the completion of innovation-related tasks. These tasks are depicted in Figure 1 in
their approximate positions relative to the innovation process.
In addition to associating innovation tasks with specific stages of the innovation process, we also classify
them according to the scale of the organisation the activity takes place. Here we distinguish between
innovation execution, which are tasks that contribute to doing the innovation, and innovation
management, which are tasks that contribute to enabling innovation by creating a supportive
organisational environment or mobilising resources (etc.) for execution activities. Some activities,
depicted in the overlapping middle section of Figure 1, are important for both innovation execution
and management. These innovation management tasks are not (always) considered innovative in and
of themselves, but are widely regarded as essential to increasing the frequency and potential for
success of innovation within organisations. Making this distinction enables us to include both execution
and management tasks in the same framework and emphasises our contention that innovation skills
are not only necessary for occupations or roles above a certain level but are critical across the entire
organisation.
4
[Page #7]
Figure 2: Innovation skills organised by category
In our framework, we assign innovation skills to each of the innovation tasks. We divide innovation
skills into five categories (see Figure 2). Conceptual skills are those that constitute an individual’s
capacity to generate, process, and engage with ideas. Evaluative skills are those that shape an
individual's capacity to find, select, and use information. Implementation skills are technical skills
associated with the active planning and undertaking of innovation execution and management and
shape how one relates to discrete tasks. Relational skills are interpersonal and social skills associated
with the effective interaction and management of human resources and particularly affect how one
relates to others. Critical self-reflection skills are a set of intrapersonal skills that underpin the
development of positive self-concept and affect how one relates to oneself as an innovator and/or
leader.

Figure 3: The innovation skill of “creativity” described generally and elaborated in the context of innovation execution and innovation management.
At a high level, the skills we identify here are not unique to the innovation process and are desirable
qualities for most roles. However, in the Framework we elaborate how they apply specifically to the
context of innovation execution and innovation management (see Figure 3 for an example).
Furthermore, the interrelationship and interdependence between skills and tasks (Figure 4) emphasises
that it is not sufficient to develop a single group of these skills, or the underlying technical knowledge
required to complete them, but that innovation tasks require the cultivation of skills across the
categories of this framework.

3. Innovation Skills Framework
How to read this framework:
Each table outlines the innovation skills within one of the five core skills groups. The Description column gives a general definition of the component skill.
The Innovation Execution column provides more detail for how that skill underpins innovation activities, while the Innovation Management column
describes how the same skill also underpins activities required to enable, encourage, and disseminate innovation. Tasks associated with each component skill
appear in each cell in bold and underlined. In digital versions, these are hyperlinked to the glossary of tasks in Appendix A.

4. Applying the Innovation Skills Framework
One of the main advantages of the Innovation Skills Framework is its versatility. The Framework was
originally developed to inform IfATE’s development of standards and qualifications; however, it became
clear through the design process that it could have broader applications in organisations of all kinds.
Here we present three stylised scenarios and outline the process to guide the translation of the
Framework into concrete outcomes. These three scenarios reflect the fact that organisations may
apply the Framework with different outcomes in mind, targeting either organisational effectiveness,
employee development, or recruitment.
4.1 Three stylised scenarios
Note that while we present these as distinctive scenarios, they should not be considered mutually
exclusive. For instance, evaluating organisational effectiveness in the deployment of skills relative to
innovation tasks might lead naturally to the conclusion that further training or hiring is necessary.
Incorporating innovation skills into recruitment processes may prompt discussions about whether
roles should be redesigned in light of innovation goals. What is vital is that an organisation can use the
Framework from any starting point and to achieve any number of desired outcomes and that it is
flexible enough to be used to develop solutions as skills strategies evolve.
Target: Organisational effectiveness
1. Deploying skills
The Framework can be used to assess the alignment between the skills that employees already possess and the functions they perform in the innovation process. In other words, what roles contribute to which innovation tasks, and to what degree do the individuals in those roles have mastery of the innovation skills necessary to perform them? This exercise might help an organisation rethink the configuration of roles related to innovation and/or the skill sets required of the employees in those positions. The outcome of this scenario is better informed decisions regarding the effective utilisation and organisation of available human resources to support innovation through an assessment of ‘fit’ between individuals and roles. Once skills gaps or weaknesses have been identified they can be addressed by using the Innovation Skills Framework to either develop (scenario 2) or source (scenario 3) relevant skill sets.
Target: Human resources development
2. Developing skills
Organisations may seek to integrate the improvement of innovation skills into existing development interventions or initiate bespoke programmes to increase innovation skills performance can use the Framework to establish curricula and assessment processes. In higher or further education, this might be related to curriculum mapping exercises to determine when and how innovation skills are introduced, reinforced, mastered, and assessed in degree programmes. For training and development organisations, like IfATE, this process can be used to evaluate whether existing
20
[Page #23]
professional standards and frameworks capture innovation skills and update standards to integrate these more effectively. Businesses can use the process to survey and refresh their training interventions.
Target: Recruitment and candidate selection processes
3. Sourcing skills
The Framework can also be used to integrate innovation skills into organisational resourcing strategies. This may involve using the Framework as a guideline to develop role descriptors and person specifications to ensure that innovation skills are among those prioritised in recruitment activity and candidate selection. It can also be used to develop selection methods to assess the innovation skills of candidates. For instance, the framework could be selectively used to develop assessment centre activities to evaluate either the possession of - or potential to develop - required innovation skills.
4.2 A roadmap for implementation
The Innovation Skills Framework is most effectively conceptualised as a point of reference and not a
solution in and of itself. To effectively apply it requires reflection about organisational goals and the
development of contextually appropriate strategies.

What tasks are important in the execution of the advertised post?
What tasks in the innovation process are relevant to the achievement of our goals?
3. Design and Execute the Evaluation Process
Review the application of innovation skills in relevant tasks by using the Framework (or parts thereof) to inform, for example, direct observation of job performance, peer assessment, or self-reporting

4.3 Tips for implementation
We describe this as a roadmap, rather than the roadmap, for implementation to emphasise the fact
that there is no one correct way to adapt the Framework to your unique organisational
circumstances. The proposed process can be pursued formulaically, with the development of
formalised assessment models and criteria and documentation appropriate to internal bureaucratic
processes, but it can be just as effective as a starting point for informal discussion (and everything in
between). Regardless of approach to engaging with the Framework, the following points may be
useful:
● Customise implementation with your organisation and its goals in mind: Like the
Framework itself, the scenarios and processes we offer here are meant to be a starting
point. Consider these guidelines, not a recipe that needs to be executed in a specific way to
ensure success.
● Take advantage of modularity: We encourage you to adopt what resonates for your
organisation and application and leave out what doesn’t. For example, not every innovation
task listed will be relevant to your organisation, roles, or objectives. In that case, focus on
what does matter and what you want to emphasise. Or, if it's more suitable to your context,
you can divide up the tasks maps across different divisions, training offerings, or
departments. That you can start from tasks and identify skills or work from desired skills
back to the tasks that they support creates flexibility to adapt the Framework in whichever
way makes sense.
● Consider existing templates for inspiration: In refining the Framework we developed
our own tools to envision how it might be applied in different contexts. We offer a selection
of these templates in Appendix B. These can be adapted or used as inspiration to design
context-specific evaluation tools.
