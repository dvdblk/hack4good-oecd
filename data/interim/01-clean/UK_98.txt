Ministerial foreword
As set out in the National Data Strategy(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-national-data-strategy/national-data-strategy#data-1-2), data is now the driving force of the world’s modern economies. Itfuels innovation in businesses large and small and has been a lifeline during theglobal coronavirus pandemic. Effective use of data can boost productivity, createnew businesses and jobs, improve public services and position the UK as theforerunner of the next wave of innovation. Notably, scarce data skills have beencritical in the deployment of research capabilities to the coronavirus response.
Data skills are important not only for companies but also individuals. Data-literateindividuals are more likely to beneﬁt from and contribute to the increasingly data-rich environments they live and work in.
I want to ensure that businesses across all sectors can get the data literateemployees they need. Many companies are experiencing real difﬁculties in ﬁndingsuch employees. With demand growing, there is an urgent need to intensify effortsto boost the number of skilled workers. We should be looking to all areas of societyto ﬁnd people with potential and talent to ﬁll these roles. I also want to ensureindividuals have the opportunities to develop their data skills.
To develop solutions and ensure we focus efforts in the right place, we need tobetter understand the demand and supply for data skills. To do this, and to informGovernment policy, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport

commissioned Opinium to undertake research. To inform their research Opiniumcontacted 1,045 businesses, 5,000 workers and 1,000 students in higher educationor training across the UK.
The research found that there is signiﬁcant demand for data skills with UKcompanies recruiting for 178,000 to 234,000 roles requiring hard data skills. Almosthalf of businesses (48%) are recruiting for roles that require hard data skills butunder half (46%) have struggled to recruit for these roles over the last 2 years. Thesupply of graduates with specialist data skills from universities is limited. Whilemany companies undertake to train their own workers internally, half of all workerssurveyed reported they had not received any data skills training within the last twoyears despite considerable interest in undertaking training.
The government is already taking action to address the data skills gap. In Autumn2020 DCMS and the Ofﬁce for AI launched a degree conversion course programmein data science and AI. The programme will create at least 2,500 graduates over 3years. The Department for Education is rolling out digital bootcamps in all Englishregions that include courses in data analysis. The National Data Strategy commitsthe government to test effective ways to teach foundational data skills to allundergraduates. We will also be looking at further ways, using the insight from theresearch, to help provide the data skills industry requires whilst recognising that thisshould be a joint effort between industry, government, academia and other trainingproviders.
I am delighted to lend my support to this research which provides detailed insightinto the current supply and demand for data skills. This information can helpaddress an increasingly important and urgent challenge - how to resolve the UK’sgrowing data skills gap.
The Rt Hon John Whittingdale OBE MPMinister of State for Media and Data
IntroductionIn our hyper-digital world, data has become integral to the UK economy. With theever-increasing advancement and adoption of technology, consumers andbusinesses are generating more data than ever before. As technological progresscontinues, the demand for ‘data skills’ is rising. The estimates of the dataeconomy’s size vary depending on its deﬁnition. The Department for Digital,Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) estimated that in 2016 the value of the UK dataeconomy was between £61.3 billion and £73.3 billion(https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/ﬁle/807517/National_Data_Strategy__Review_of_commonly_quoted_statistics.pdf).Some researchers believe that the full potential value of the country’s dataeconomy could be considerably more. Digital Reality, a data centre provider,estimates that the UK data economy could have potentially been worth as much as

£125 billion in 2016 (https://www.dataiq.co.uk/articles/articles/uks-data-economy-worth-ps73-billion-potential-greater).
As technology changes, the nature of jobs is changing too. This is increasing thedemand for data skills: fewer good jobs are focused on routine tasks, and a greaternumber of jobs now require complex expert thinking and communication.[footnote 1]For our businesses to remain globally competitive, the UK must improve itscapabilities in data analysis.[footnote 2] Published in September 2020, the NationalData Strategy (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-national-data-strategy/national-data-strategy) recognises that the data revolution has implicationsnot only for experts with advanced analytical skills, but for the entire UK workforce.While not every worker needs to become a data scientist, everyone will need abasic level of data literacy to operate and thrive in increasingly ‘data-rich’environments.
Research has also shown that effective data use can deliver signiﬁcant productivitybeneﬁts to a business and the wider economy. Nesta, an innovation foundation,has proven that data-active companies are more productive than those who aremore reluctant to embrace data.[footnote 3] A report by the University of Brussels andMcKinsey (consulting ﬁrm) ﬁnds that more productive ﬁrms are also faster adoptersof “big data” compared to their industry peers.[footnote 4]
As strong data capabilities become more important, employers are looking forprofessionals with skills in the architecture, retrieval, and analysis of large sets ofdata. Research from DCMS predicts that data analysis will become the fastestgrowing digital skills cluster, increasing by an estimated 33% in the next ﬁve years.

It is therefore important for policy makers to understand the existing and futuresupply of skills in order to meet this demand in the UK(https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/ﬁle/807830/No_Longer_Optional_Employer_Demand_for_Digital_Skills.pdf).
A considerable body of research has demonstrated that the UK suffers from a dataskills gap. However, there is disagreement over its size, and whether this gap willgrow as a result of the UK’s post-Brexit relationship with the EU. In this context,DCMS has commissioned a quantitative assessment of the mismatch between thedemand and supply of data skills, recommending regional and industry-speciﬁcmeasures wherever possible.
Opinium Research was commissioned to:
Deﬁne the ‘data skills gap’ in order to measure it.Measure and monitor the ‘data skills gap’, determine the origin of theskills gap, identify the sectors most in demand for skilled workers, andunderstand the current supply of skilled workers.Investigate drivers behind the demand for ‘data skills’
The ﬁndings of this report are based both on desk research and quantitative onlinesurveys. The researchers would like to thank Danya Long and Sandy Grom atDCMS, Dr Matthew Forshaw from the Alan Turing Institute and NewcastleUniversity, members of the Data Skills Taskforce and Professor Pat TissingtonAcademic Director: Employability and Skills of Warwick University.
Recruitment freezes experienced in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemicmay have impacted the estimates of data skills demand incorporated in this report.It is still too soon to understand the medium-term impacts of the pandemic, whichcould conceivably decrease or increase data skills training and recruitment. Thiswill depend largely on whether companies try and afford to “catch-up” after losingrevenue. Some businesses, particularly tech companies, have even thrived duringthe pandemic.

Quantifying the UK Data Skills Gap - Full report - GOV.UK
Executive summary
This report seeks to deﬁne the data skills gap in the UK. Our deﬁnition of data skillsis “any skill that involves the gathering, interpretation and communication of data,often as part of a team”. We take a holistic approach recognising that, withinindividual businesses, skills needs are different and not met by single employees,but by teams working together. These skills cover a range of technical (hard) skillsand generalist (softer) skills relating to good work practices in the context of data.
To understand the UK’s data skills gap, we spoke to 1,045 businesses, 5,000workers and 1,000 students in higher education or training across the UK. Thislarge-scale study of businesses, employees and students provides evidence on: (i)the overall need for data skills in the UK economy; (ii) the speciﬁc needs for dataskills, depending on business sizes and sectors; and (iii) where a future focus ontraining and recruitment might lie.
The scale of demand
Nearly half (48%) of businesses we interviewed were recruiting for data roles.However, this varied hugely depending on businesses’ size, with smallerbusinesses much less inclined to recruit for these roles. This survey was conductedduring the COVID-19 pandemic. We further discuss the pandemic’s impact onrecruitment in subsequent sections of the report. It is likely that the pandemic haslowered recruitment for data roles, with some companies pausing talent acquisition.

This suggests that our estimates may underestimate the number of recruitingcompanies and data-speciﬁc vacancies in the UK. According to the ONS’ labourmarket survey(https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/jobsandvacanciesintheuk/july2020), job vacancies in the UK betweenApril to June 2020 hit their lowest level since the survey began in 2001, withvacancies decreasing in most sectors.
When recruiting for data roles, businesses were most often looking for a “dataanalyst” (12% of businesses surveyed were recruiting for this role), especially atjunior or entry level.
There are potentially 178,000 to 234,000 data roles to be ﬁlled
Hard data skills[footnote 5] are relevant to a range of workers, not just those inspecialist data roles. We estimate on this broader level that UK businesses, in needof hard data skills, are recruiting for 215,000-234,000 roles:[footnote 6] 215,000 rolesin businesses that require hard data skills, beyond basic IT skills,[footnote 7] and afurther 19,000 roles in businesses that require only basic IT skills as a hard skill.Our broad deﬁnition of ‘data skills’ covers a range of roles, from more data-heavyspecialist roles, where employees are using data for the majority of their work, tomore generalist ones, requiring some hard data skills for a smaller proportion of thework. When narrowing down the deﬁnition to look at businesses recruiting forspeciﬁc data specialist roles and those that require ‘hard’ data skills, we estimated178,000 vacancies. In these roles, the majority of the work is centred around dataand requires more advanced data knowledge.
Almost half of businesses (46%) have struggled to recruit for roles thatrequire data skills
Over the last two years, just under half (46%) of businesses have struggled torecruit for roles that require data skills. The difﬁculty of recruitment differs bybusiness size, although this is also the result of smaller businesses being less likelyto recruit for data roles in the ﬁrst place (explored further in the report). Over half(55%) of large and medium (54%) sized businesses have struggled to recruit,compared to three in ten (30%) of smaller businesses and one in ten microbusinesses. Businesses tend to ﬁnd it difﬁcult to recruit for roles in higher demand .One in ten (9%) have difﬁculty ﬁlling a “data analyst” role, with a similar proportion(8%) ﬁndng it difﬁcult to ﬁll a “Head of Data” position.

Despite the fact that almost half of businesses are seeking to ﬁll data roles, almostthree ﬁfths (58%) think that their organisation has sufﬁcient data skills to meet theircurrent and future needs, while one in seven (14%) do not think they do, and overone in four (27%) are neutral on whether they do or not. Many companies maybelieve that they have the skills they need due to the lack of understanding of howdata skills can beneﬁt them in the future.
Businesses need more information management skills, knowledge ofemerging technologies and solutions, data communication skills, anddatabase management skills
Based on respondents’ views on the importance of data skills and their currentlevels of performance, we have identiﬁed the skills that companies most require.These are: information management, knowledge of emerging technologies andsolutions, data communication skills, communication and database management.Overall, these cover a range of hard and soft skills.[footnote 8]
Of the top three soft skills required by employers, the gap in communication andadaptability skills is more acute in medium-sized businesses; whilst the need for an“analytical mindset” was felt most strongly in small businesses.
For hard skills, the gap in information management and data communication isparticularly acute in small businesses. This may be caused by small businessesshowing a generally lower performance across all data skills, compared to otherbusiness sizes. In particular, small businesses show poorer performance in harddata skills compared to medium and large sized businesses.
Small businesses are signiﬁcantly more likely than medium and large sizedbusinesses to have no existing data roles, both at board level and at lower levels,with a third of small businesses having no existing data roles. They are alsosigniﬁcantly less likely than medium and large businesses to be recruiting for anydata roles.
Around a quarter of businesses said that their sectors had insufﬁcient data skills inmachine learning (25%), programming (22%), knowledge of emerging technologiesand solutions (23%), and advanced statistics (22%).
The supply of data skills
This report considers two key sources of data skills supply: new talent and up-skilled workers. New talent primarily consists of students from Higher Education.However, the analysis of Higher Education Statistics Agency data prepared for theData Skills Taskforce[footnote 9] estimated that there is very limited scope, especiallyin the short run, for Higher Education to ﬁll the gap alone. The estimated potentialsupply of data scientists from UK universities is unlikely to be more than 10,000 peryear, based on data on graduates from UK universities between 2017-2018. It istherefore vital to look at upskilling the current workforce to try and plug the gap indemand for data skills.

Future skills provision
Employers are positive about their ability to identify and address trainingneeds, often because it is happening internally
Employers express positive attitudes to data skills training. Two thirds of employersreport that they are conﬁdent in identifying skills gaps within their workforce (64%).A slightly smaller proportion of employers indicate that they are conﬁdent in ﬁndingresources to train their employees (57%).
Training is most likely to be taking place internally. Over half (56%) of businessessurveyed said that their organisation preferred to develop data skills internallyrather than outsource or recruit new workers with these skills. Despite this apparentpreference for internal training, UK businesses are still recruiting for up to 234,000data roles.
In our survey, employers highlighted cost as one of the biggest barriers to dataskills training. This was followed by difﬁculties in ﬁnding training that is relevant toan organisation and has practical relevance to an individual’s day-to-day job.Universities were not seen by employers as a signiﬁcant source of data skillstraining for staff. Only one in seven (14%) businesses who have sent employees todata skills training in the last two years have put them through university taughtprogrammes, while only one in fourteen (7%) have sent their employees touniversity continuing professional development courses.

As set out above, employers cite high costs (29%) as the main barrier to seekingout more data related training for their employees. This rises to over a third (35%)for businesses in the South West, and a third in the North West, Yorkshire and theHumber and the East of England (all 32%). In fact, cost was identiﬁed as a keybarrier across all sizes of business, although the size of its importance variesacross them. Small businesses (10-49 employees) are more likely to say cost is abarrier (36%) compared to medium (30%) and large (28%) businesses.
Interestingly, smaller businesses (49% of micro businesses vs 23% of largebusinesses) are more likely to say that there are no barriers, despite or perhapsbecause they are less likely to access data training for their employees.
Three in ﬁve (60%) workers who have not received any data skills training said dataskills do not add any signiﬁcant value, compared to 19% of those who havereceived this type of training. This suggests that those who do receive training maybe signiﬁcantly more likely to see the value of data skills in their job. Similarly, ourresearch shows that smaller companies are less likely to offer data skills training.Workers in smaller businesses are also less likely to say that data skills addsigniﬁcant value to their job or company. Two thirds (68%) of sole traders and half(48%) of those working in micro businesses (2-9 employees) said that there was nosigniﬁcant impact, compared to over a third (35%) of those in medium sizedbusinesses (50-249 employees), and 36% in large businesses (250+ employees).
For workers, cost and time constraints were the biggest barriers to accessing dataskills training. Cost (29%) and lack of time (28%) were the most common barriers to

data skills training cited by workers, followed by a lack of availability of the kind oftraining they are interested in (13%).
Data skills training is felt to improve productivity and reduce stress, butthere isn’t enough
Workers told us that when data skills training was relevant to their day-to-day job, itimproved their productivity or innovation and reduced stress levels. It is alsoapparent that the need for data skills is increasing, and that the majority of workersare interested in acquiring these skills. Seven in ten (70%) workers interviewedexpressed interest in seeking out data skills training, and half (46%) stated that theneed for them to have data skills has increased over the past ﬁve years (incontrast, only 4% said the need has decreased). In spite of this, we found thatacross all employees, half had not received any data skills training within the lasttwo years. The lack of training despite high demand from both employers andemployees suggests that the challenge of ensuring appropriate training provision iscomplex.
The current priorities for businesses for speciﬁc hard data skills training are dataethics and basic IT skills. These also represent two of the top ﬁve data skills thatemployees currently receive training for, along with leadership, projectmanagement and industry expertise.
For soft skills, communication, professionalism and problem solving are thepriorities.

The next generation
There is a mismatch between students’ self-assessment of their industryor subject matter expertise and the reality. Businesses also want them todevelop leadership and communication skills
Around a quarter of businesses said that graduates who work with data need todevelop their leadership (26%) and communication (23%) skills.
Students (classiﬁed as any adults in higher education or training) are generallyoptimistic about their current skills and expect to improve further. For example, overtwo ﬁfths (45%) of students rate their current industry/sector expertise asexcellent/good, while over two thirds (68%) expect it to be excellent/good at the endof their studies. More than half expect to be good or excellent at advanced statistics(61%), data visualisation (69%), machine learning (59%) and knowledge ofemerging technologies (68%).
Half (49%) of those in higher education or training felt that thetraining or education path to becoming a data scientist is clear,while two ﬁfths (39%) thought it was unclear.

Deﬁning data skills
How existing literature deﬁnes data skills
There is no agreed deﬁnition in the existing literature of what data skillsencompass, or even exactly what constitutes a data scientist. Instead, there areseveral deﬁnitions that range from relatively narrow to relatively broad perspectives.
Literature that followed a narrow deﬁnition focused on expert technical skills. Forexample, The Data Economy Report deﬁnes the data economy as: “the ﬁnancialand economic value created by the storage, retrieval and analysis - viasophisticated software and other tools - of large volumes of highly detailedbusiness and organisational data at very high speeds”. With this deﬁnition, 3.3% ofnational employment is accounted for by the data economy.[footnote 10]
However, most literature focuses on a more comprehensive picture, combiningtechnical skills with other skills that help to interpret data. The Model Workersreport from Nesta & RSS argues that a data scientist should have programming

and database skills to access data effectively. They should also have the statisticalskills, according to the report, needed to extract insights from data, as well as thebusiness knowledge to transform data insights into impacts. The report includes aproﬁle of the ideal data analyst, who has a combination of hard and soft skills.[footnote 11]
Similarly, reports from International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), SASInstitute Inc. and the Graduate Employability and University of Warwick GraduateSkills[footnote 12] show that a range of skills are required that could be grouped as‘data skills’. These include analysing data, numeracy, information management,analysis skills, critical thinking, ethical use of data, the application of results tolearning and decision making, and problem solving.
In line with this, the Data Governance, Data Literacy and the Management of DataQuality Report suggests that, taking all these deﬁnitions together, data literacy canbe deﬁned as a speciﬁc skill set and knowledge base, which empowers individualsto transform data into information and actionable knowledge by enabling them toaccess, interpret, critically assess, manage and ethically use data.[footnote 13]
Likewise, in an attempt to assess the productivity and data capabilities of anorganization, the Joint National Conservation Committee presents a report outlininga framework for the assessment of data skills within seven categories(requirements and business analysis, data governance, data management, accessand security, data manipulation, analysis and modelling, and communication andvisualisation) across three tiers (foundation, intermediate and advanced).[footnote 14]
In a recent article (https://blogs.oracle.com/datascience/skills-that-linkedin-looks-for-in-a-data-scientist), the social media company LinkedIn summarised what they look forwhen recruiting for a data scientist candidate.This involved a combination of hardand soft skills: “Ultimately, the goal is to take the insights generated from theanalysis and effectively inﬂuence critical decision-making, which drives businessimpact. The ‘hard skills’ and ‘soft skills’ need to work together for the success of adata scientist.” They identiﬁed some key overarching skills required such as datawrangling/manipulation, statistics knowledge and statistical modelling/machinelearning. Soft skills such as communication, project management and inﬂuence,and problem-solving abilities were also required.
Our approach to measuring data skills
Most of the literature refers to a wide deﬁnition of data skills. Real-world examplesof recruitment also highlight a combination of soft and hard skills. As a result, thisreport uses a broad deﬁnition of data skills, but also sub-categorises them intosmaller, more speciﬁc skills. This provides us with a range of distinct soft and hardskills to measure, and allows us to use a number of measures to understand dataskills and, in particular, which skills are needed most. Our deﬁnition of data skillsalso accounts for the fact that employees in many organisations operate as a team,and no single person has all the necessary skills to meet an organisation’s dataskills needs.

Companies that are supported by data-enabled infrastructure and a high number ofdata professionals have been proven to be up to 10% more productive than theircounterparts (https://media.nesta.org.uk/documents/analytic_britain.pdf). In the lastdecade, economic growth has been hampered by ﬁnancial crises, and there is alsocurrently considerable uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In thiscontext, a rigorous assessment and understanding of the current state of UK dataskills is a necessary and useful step to improve the country’s economic future.[footnote 15] Later in this report, we examine the demand for and supply of data-related jobs in the UK. But before that, we must ﬁrst take a wider view of the currentprevalence of data roles in UK businesses.
More than one in ﬁve employers (22%) in our survey do not have any dataprofessionals employed within their organisation. There is a signiﬁcant correlationbetween employment of data professionals and business size. Three in four (75%)micro businesses do not have anyone employed in a data role, compared to one inten (9%) large businesses.
Figure 1. Percentage of companies that do not have anyone in a data role bybusiness size
Overall, around three in ten businesses employ ‘generalist’[footnote 16] dataprofessionals (27%), whilst fewer have ‘specialist’[footnote 17] data professionals intheir workforce (17%).
Data roles are also not that common at a senior level, with only one in ﬁve (22%)businesses surveyed saying that they have a data role at a senior managementlevel.[footnote 18] At a more junior level this drops further, with under a ﬁfth (17%) ofbusinesses employing someone at a standard executive level[footnote 19] within adata role.
The relative prevalence of each role is presented in the chart below:
Figure 2. Percentage of companies with a given data role
One in ﬁve data professionals are outsourced
Costs are a signiﬁcant barrier to establishing data teams within a business. Therelative shortage of people with sufﬁcient data skills frequently leads businesses tooutsource work, or stretch budgets to attract talent. “Data engineering” roles arepaid the highest median salary, and have experienced the greatest growth in salarybetween 2013-2017 of all skills clusters.[footnote 20]
Across the data roles we surveyed, on average,[footnote 21] six in ten dataprofessionals were employed on a company payroll (59%). Meanwhile, one in tendata professionals were outsourced domestically (9%), with a slightly smallerproportion of professionals outsourced internationally (7%). See Figure 3 for moredetail. A further 3% of data roles were outsourced through a mixture of domesticand international recruitment. Generally, rates of employment and outsourcing areunaffected by a role’s seniority, though chief executives employed in data roles are

around 10% more likely to exist on a company’s payroll compared to other dataroles.
The breakdown of recruitment methods by relative levels of seniority are presentedin the chart below:
Figure 3. Percentage of data roles by method of recruitment – by seniority
Typically, these trends are consistent amongst all surveyed employers. Thoseworking within the public and third sectors have a greater tendency to keep dataprofessionals on an internal company payroll (an average of around 80%). In theprivate sector, skilled data professionals were somewhat less likely to be employedon internal payrolls.
Machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence specialists are much less likely to be ona company payroll than other data roles, which are more likely to be ﬁlled throughdomestic outsourcing. The percentage differences are presented in the chart below.
Figure 4. Top 5 roles least likely to be on payroll, % difference vs. UK average
Two thirds of companies have someone at board level responsible fordata
As employers prepare their businesses for the “data economy”, the appointment ofa Chief Data Ofﬁcer (CDO) is often considered as a signal of intent to develop thecompany’s data capability. Researchers have found that businesses with a CDOare twice as likely to have a clear digital strategy as those without.[footnote 22]Around two thirds of businesses with a CDO self-report that they outperform rivalsin terms of market share and data-driven innovation.[footnote 23]
Our research has found that two thirds (67%) of businesses have an employee atboard level overseeing or focused on the application of data, even if they do nothave the title of CDO. Employees overseeing the application of data may haveother responsibilities. The existence of a person in these roles is strongly correlatedwith internal resource. Large businesses (75%) are signiﬁcantly more likely to havea data-focused employee at board level (compared to 34% of micro-businesses).Public (71%) and private (67%) sector businesses are also more likely to have aboard-level data specialist than third sector businesses (61%).
Figure 5. Existence of board-level employees responsible for data – bybusiness size and sector
Summary and implications
The current state of data roles and skills in UK business is highly varied, andis particularly impacted by business size.Smaller businesses are much less likely to have an employee in a data role,and are less likely to have someone at a board level overseeing data. Thissuggests they are missing opportunities to make better use of harnessing

data. Across all businesses, the widespread outsourcing of ‘specialist’ dataprofessionals casts doubt over the preparedness of UK businesses, and theability of companies to develop this expertise internally.There are fewer qualiﬁed applicants for specialist roles than generalist roles,meaning that wages in specialist roles are likely to be higher. These higherstaff costs have the potential to be a signiﬁcant barrier for UK businesses.
The demand for data skillsAs technology continues to advance and the volume of available data expands,demand for data skills is increasing. This demand is further accelerating as newtechnologies such as cloud infrastructure services are reducing the cost of storingand managing data.[footnote 24] More workers will need at least a base level of dataskills to adequately perform their jobs.
Levels of demand for data skills vary across different organisations, and depend onhow data is used during the day to day work. Nesta’s ‘Skills of the Datavores’ reportidentiﬁed four groups based on their research of 400 companies.[footnote 25]Datavores make up 16% of companies; they make heavy use of data and analysisfor decision making. Data builders (22%) use ‘big’ datasets requiring dedicatedservers or ‘possibly multiple’ clusters for parallel processing. The third group is datamixers (31%); these are companies that collect and combine data from varioussources. The ﬁnal group is Dataphobes (30%); companies that work with smalldatasets, few data sources, and do not use data or analysis to make decisions.
Very little in the existing literature provides a clear number specifying the demandfor data jobs, particularly in the UK. In the US, an IBM/Burning Glass reportsuggests that by 2020 the number of data and analytics jobs will be almost 3million, and job vacancies for ‘data scientists and similar advanced analytical roleswill reach 61,799’.[footnote 26] 3 million jobs equates to roughly 2% of the USworkforce. Loosely applied to the UK, 2% would equal roughly 650,000 jobs in theUK.
The estimated 61,799 advanced analytical roles suggested in the IBM/BurningGlass report ‘represents just 2% of the projected demand across all job rolesrequiring data and analytics skill’.[footnote 27] This lack of demand highlights a needfor research into existing levels of demand for data skills in the UK. The nextsection of this report quantiﬁes the demand for data skills by looking at recruitmentneeds.
Hiring/roles needed (the recruitment gap)
To understand the need for data skills in the UK, and establish the existence - orlack thereof - a recruitment gap, we ﬁrst need to understand current recruitmentpatterns. Each business in our survey was asked to tell us how many data skillsroles they were currently recruiting for, and we then extrapolated how many dataskills roles businesses are looking to ﬁll across the UK.

Half of businesses are recruiting for roles that require data skills
Half (48%) of the businesses we spoke to were recruiting for roles that requireddata skills. The most common type of data role sought by businesses was a dataanalyst (12% of businesses were recruiting for this role). This is one of the mostcommon roles that currently exists, and likely encompasses many junior or entry-level roles. After this, the most common roles being sought were fairly seniorpositions; one in ten (10%) were recruiting for a Head of Data, with similarproportions recruiting for a Data Manager (9%), a Chief Technology Ofﬁcer (8%)and a Data Protection Ofﬁcer (8%). It is important to note that the need for dataskills is not only conﬁned to people in specialist data roles; virtually all white-collarworkers will increasingly need to have a basic understanding of data. As mentionedin the Analytic Britain report, “The data revolution has implications…for the entireworkforce. We all need to become more data literate to operate successfully inincreasingly ‘data-rich’ environments.”[footnote 28]
Figure 6. Percentage of companies currently recruiting for each of thefollowing roles
There were regional variations in desired positions. A data analyst was the mostcommon type of role being sought by businesses in the North West, East Midlands(both 15%), London (16%) and South East (13%). Meanwhile, in Scotland, themost common role was data scientist (19%). Businesses in the West Midlandswere most likely to be recruiting for a Head of Data. In contrast, businesses in theEast of England were most likely to be recruiting for either a Head of Data or aChief Technology Ofﬁcer (both 8%).
There were also variations across business sizes. The smaller a business, the lesslikely they were to be recruiting for any of these roles. Nine in ten (91%) micro-businesses were not recruiting for any of these roles, compared to two thirds (67%)of small businesses, just under half (46%) of medium-sized businesses and twoﬁfths (40%) of large businesses.
Number of roles sought by UK businesses
The number of data roles that UK businesses are seeking depends on ourdeﬁnition of data skills. Referring to the wide and narrow deﬁnitions of data skillsidentiﬁed in the existing literature, we have arrived at two ﬁgures to provide a fairrange.
Hard data skills are relevant to a range of workers, not just those in specialist dataroles. We estimate, on this broader level, that UK businesses in need of hard dataskills are recruiting for 215,000-234,000 roles incorporating such skills.[footnote 29]As previously mentioned, within this wider deﬁnition there will be a range of roles,from the more data heavy specialist roles (where they are using data for themajority of their work), to more generalist roles that (requiring some hard data skillsthat may only make up a smaller proportion of their work). Other research hasargued that as data skills are relevant to a wide range of workers, all workers

should have a base level of data skill, as it affects every business. Steven Miller, aprevious Talent & Skills Ecosystem Strategist at IBM, argues that data does not justimpact IT and tech jobs, but a wider range of roles, such as sales, marketing,manufacturing etc. Consequently, ‘data and analytics literacy must become anexpectation across all curricula, regardless of the ultimate ﬁeld or degree pursued’.[footnote 30]
Narrowing the deﬁnition to look at those recruiting for speciﬁc data specialist rolesand businesses requiring ‘hard’ data skills, we estimate that UK businesses arerecruiting for 178,000 data specialist roles. In these roles, the majority of the workwill centre around data, and the job would require more advanced data knowledge.
Just over a ﬁfth of businesses (22%) said they require Basic IT skills. This isperhaps unsurprising, with many modern white-collar jobs requiring at least a basicunderstanding of IT. After Basic IT skills, the top 5 skills needed are all soft skills; aﬁfth (21%) of businesses said they were in need of project management orproblem-solving skills, and over one in six (18%) were in need of critical thinkingskills and professionalism. This is followed by hard data skills, with the sameproportion saying they need analysis and database management skills (both 18%).
Figure 7. Top 10 skills UK businesses are in need of
The skills required vary slightly by company size. The most commonly cited skillsrequired for micro businesses (2-9 employees) and medium sized businesses(26%) are Basic IT skills. For small businesses (10-49 employees) it iscommunication skills (22%) and for large businesses (250+ employees) it isproblem solving skills (24%).The biggest variations by business size are for thosewho do not require any data skills. Micro businesses (9 or fewer employees) andsmaller businesses are more likely to say they do not require these skills (46% and25% respectively), compared to medium sized and large businesses (13% and15% respectively). The next chapter also corroborates this, with micro businessesbeing less likely than larger businesses to say that data skills are important to theirbusiness. There were some regional variations in the proportion of businesses thatsaid they needed particular skills.
Businesses in the East of England were more likely to say they are not in need ofany of these data skills (38% vs the average of 20%).Meanwhile, businesses in London were more likely to require basic IT skills (27%vs the average of 22%) and database management skills (24% vs the average of18%).Those based in Yorkshire and the Humber and the Southwest were more likely toneed professionalism (both 25% vs the average of 18%).Conversely, businesses in the North West tended to be more in need of harddata skills compared to the national average: data processing (22% vs averageof 17%), data ethics (20% vs average of 15%), knowledge of emergingtechnologies and solutions (21% vs average of 14%), subject matter expertise(19% vs average of 13%), and machine learning (18% vs average of 13%).Those in the East Midlands were more likely to need data visualisation skills(22% vs average of 14%), data communication skills (22% vs average of 14%),

and collaboration and creativity skills (both 18% vs average of 12%)Businesses in the West Midlands were more likely to need advanced statisticsskills (19% vs 14% respectively)
Barriers to recruitment
Just under half of businesses have struggled when recruiting for rolesrequiring data skills in the last two years
Over the last two years, just under half (46%) of businesses have struggled torecruit for roles requiring data skills. Difﬁculties in recruiting vary by business size,although this is also the result of smaller businesses being less likely to recruit fordata roles. Over half (55%) of large and medium (54%) size businesses havestruggled with recruitment compared to 30% of smaller businesses and one in tenmicro businesses.
Figure 8. Percentage of UK businesses who have struggled to recruit for adata role over the last two years – by business size
Businesses in the Midlands have faced particular difﬁculties ﬁlling roles; over half(55%) of businesses in the Midlands have struggled to recruit for data roles in thelast 2 years compared to the national average of 46%. Public sector companieswere also more likely to struggle with this compared to private sector companies(58% vs 43% respectively).
Looking at only the companies that have previously tried to recruit for data roles,business size again has an impact on recruitment. Just under half (46%) ofmicro/small companies that have previously tried to recruit for data roles havestruggled with ﬁlling a post in the last 2 years, compared to seven in ten (69%)medium sized businesses and two thirds (66%) of large businesses.
As other research has shown, this struggle with recruitment leads to skills-shortagevacancies (i.e. the percentage of vacancies that are difﬁcult to ﬁll due to skillshortages). The Employer Skills survey in 2017 found that total vacancies, as aresult of all skills shortages, have remained stable at 22% since 2013.[footnote 31]
The most common roles that businesses have struggled to ﬁll generally mirror themost common roles being recruited for. One in ten (9%) have struggled to ﬁll a dataanalyst role, with a similar proportion (8%) struggling with recruiting for a Head ofData. While the struggle for both is a concern, the difﬁculties in recruiting for aHead of Data (or other senior roles for which there is only one person in theorganisation responsible for that area) is particularly important, as the impact of nothaving a Head of Data (where one is sought) is likely to have a greater impact onthe data capability and vision of an organisation as a whole.
Figure 9. Percentage of UK businesses who have struggled to recruit for thefollowing data roles in the last two years vs those who are currentlyrecruiting for this role

Success rates in recruitment depend on the size of the business. Micro/smallbusinesses (28%) that have struggled to ﬁll data roles in the past two years, aremore likely to have struggled with recruiting for a Head of Data in comparison tomedium (19%) and large businesses (16%). Currently, one in ﬁve (20%)micro/small businesses are recruiting for a Head of Data role, compared to one inseven (14%) of medium sized businesses and over a ﬁfth (21%) of largebusinesses. This indicates that, while a similar proportion of large and micro/smallbusinesses are hiring for a Head of Data, micro and small businesses are ﬁnding itharder than large businesses to recruit for this type of role.
However, this is not the case for all roles. A similar proportion of micro/small andlarge businesses are currently recruiting for an Intelligence Analyst (both 11%).
Financial costs and a lack of individuals with the right skills are thebiggest barriers to establishing data competency in a business
We asked businesses about their ability to build data teams (and not just hireindividuals). Teams of individuals with complementary skills are usually required asit is unlikely that any one individual will have the perfect mix of technical and softskills required.[footnote 32]
For many businesses in our survey, ﬁnancial costs and a lack of people with theright skills were the most signiﬁcant barriers to establishing a data role or teamwithin their organisation. Over a ﬁfth (22%) of businesses in our survey said thatsalary expectations of new hires were a barrier, while a similar number (21%)mentioned that the ﬁnancial costs of implementation were a limitation.
Figure 10. Biggest barriers to establishing a data role/team in UK businesses
There are regional differences for the most signiﬁcant barriers. The salaryexpectations of new hires was the biggest barrier in the East Midlands, WestMidlands (both 30%), South East (23%) and South West (21%). For businesses inthe East of England (25%) and London (26%), the ﬁnancial cost of creating a datarole or team was the biggest barrier. Conversely, the top barrier for businesses inScotland (31%) and the North West (24%) was a lack of workers with the right levelof experience and skills. Businesses in Yorkshire and the Humber are most likely tosay that the limitations of current IT architecture are the biggest barrier. Third sectorbusinesses (25%) were also the most likely to mention limitations of IT architecture,while businesses in the private (22%) and public sector (26%) mentioned salaryexpectations of new hires as the most signiﬁcant obstacle.
Perceptions of barriers also vary according to business size, although this can bepartly attributed to the fact that many smaller businesses are not trying to establishthese teams or roles at all. Just under half (48%) of micro businesses are notestablishing data roles or teams, compared to a ﬁfth (20%) of small businesses,one in ten (11%) medium sized businesses and one in fourteen (7%) largebusinesses.

Salary was one of the most commonly cited reasons for businesses struggling torecruit over the past 2 years:
“There seems to be intense competition for talent at the moment and I don’tthink our salary rates are competitive enough.”
“My company signiﬁcantly underestimated the salary requirements of thesespecialist positions.”
”Salaries in [the] charity sector not being competitive.”
“We are a small ﬁrm and these roles are scarce and expensive.”
“There is never enough funding for these high-end roles.”
It should also be noted that smaller businesses often struggle with funding forinvestment due to difﬁculty of securing ﬁnance from lenders.[footnote 33]
Key barriers to company recruitment included; a lack of people with the right levelof skill and experience (20%), a lack of people with the right mix of data skills(20%), with one in six (17%) citing the extensive training required for new recruits.This mirrors ﬁndings from other surveys and reports. The Model Workers reportfound that four in ﬁve companies were experiencing difﬁculties ﬁnding the peoplethat they needed, particularly businesses outside of London. Overall, people withgood data skills were in short supply, and the candidates available in the labourmarket lacked the right skills and experience. Additionally, available data talentoften lacked the right combination of skills: good analysts often cannot code, andgood coders often cannot analyse.[footnote 34] The Making the Most of Data reportalso found that employers struggle with ﬁnding people with the right mix of skills.[footnote 35]
Companies that struggled to recruit during the past two years gave similarresponses:
“There [are] not many people qualiﬁed to work with big data”
“Not many people are getting degrees in that sector”
“Less people are training for this type of job and not enough qualiﬁed ones areavailable”
“Because there are many people whose majors do not meet the requirementsof our organization. A lot of people apply for jobs that don’t match their majors”
“Lack of high level qualiﬁcations. We seek personnel who have achieved amaster’s degree and upwards in the ﬁeld of computer science”
Higher education qualiﬁcations are a core requirement when recruiting for thesepositions, particularly for more specialist data roles.

Quantifying the UK Data Skills Gap - Full report - GOV.UK
A lack of candidates with the right mix of skills and expertise was anothercommonly cited reason for struggling with recruitment:
“Our market is quite niche, and ﬁnding good data analysts who can put thingsinto context has been difﬁcult.”
“There is a shortage of well-qualiﬁed data workers with sector knowledge”
“There are not many experienced data analysts available or have the correctsector experience“
“We want people with experience to do this job, and not just a degree. Data issomething conﬁdential, and we don’t want to take any kind of risk”
“There are simply too few people with the right skillset available. Those that aretend to want unrealistic beneﬁts packages that are outside of the remit for ourcompany.”
A shortage of people with the right level of experience, skills and qualiﬁcations hasmeant that businesses must compete over those that do tick all the right boxes:
“We are in a competitive market and require very speciﬁc skills for our industryso there aren’t that many candidates with the right combination of skill andexperience that are looking for new positions.”
“Few qualiﬁed people are available in my industry, there is ﬁerce competition toﬁll roles/vacancies as they arise in changing circumstances.”
“A role that all organisations need and ﬁnding someone with the rightexperience was hard as the market has been very competitive in this area overthe last few years.”
Other reasons for recruitment challenges
There was also a sense that a business’s location led to difﬁculties withrecruitment, with some areas being more desirable than others.
“There [aren’t] many people with the right qualiﬁcations or work experience inour local area” “No one around wales has the qualiﬁcations”
“Because it is a small town in the north and not many people trained for theseroles outside of big cities.”
“We think it is down to location and in general, most engineers being based inmain cities such as London, Birmingham or Manchester.”
“We can’t pay enough and no one wants to live in mid Wales doing this.”

As well as location, there was a sense among some businesses that certain typesof organisations and sectors were less attractive than others, making it difﬁcult to ﬁlldata roles:
“Not many people want to work in the health service.”
“Few people with the required skills want to work in education as they cancommand better salaries and career prospects in other sectors.”
“Not many willing to work for a private school.”
Some businesses also mentioned that Brexit was making it harder for them torecruit and keep talent:
“People who come from [the] EU now [don’t] want to do it up to Brexit.”
“Many of our non-British citizen staff have gone home because of Brexit. Wedon’t train for these skills in the UK.”
“We have struggled to recruit for data roles because [of the] UK getting out of[the] EU.”
Many businesses mentioned that they were struggling to recruit for data rolesbecause there was a shortage of people applying for those roles. Certainbusinesses even suggested that no-one wants to do those roles. To overcome thisrecruitment barriers, businesses have reacted in various ways, including by re-advertising a position, with many struggling to ﬁnd alternatives:
“Had to re-advertise as not enough interest”
“[W]e have had to redeﬁne the role duties 2 or 3 times to try and attract morepeople for the post”
“The suitable person has not applied. It is difﬁcult to know why and how we canget around this.”
Almost one in ﬁve (18%) businesses in our survey mentioned that a lack of localstaff expertise was a barrier to establishing a data team or role. The Model Workersreport by Nesta & the Royal Statistical Society also found that some companiesthat were ﬁnding this to be a barrier were offshoring or considering offshoring theirdata analysis capabilities to a location outside the UK (e.g. China or India), wheredata experts were often cheaper.[footnote 36] Our survey found that one in ﬁve dataprofessionals in UK businesses are outsourced. Previous research has revealedthat a lack of local expertise does create barriers to recruitment for somebusinesses. This can prevent businesses from establishing experienced datateams, as they often struggle to understand the specialist roles they require.[footnote37]

Existing literature also identiﬁes the education system as one reason for companiesnot ﬁnding the data skills they are seeking. The State of the Nation report by theBritish Academy and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research(NIESR) states that data governance is not given sufﬁcient prominence in theacademic syllabus, despite the ethical handling of data being an important issue.[footnote 38] The risks associated with data (i.e. GDPR, IT security, and ethicalconsiderations) was a barrier for (14%) of companies in establishing a datafunction.This highlights the importance of a business having a basic level of dataknowledge in order to mitigate these risks. Some businesses also cited lack ofrigour in our education system as a barrier:
“There is no rigorous maths education in this country whatsoever. All of ourhighly specialized maths-oriented roles require overseas recruits.”
For some businesses, the COVID-19 pandemic has created further difﬁculties inrecruiting individuals with data skills. One in ten (10%) businesses that havestruggled to recruit in the last two years cited this reason for their difﬁculties. Somebusinesses paused recruitment or were too afraid to hire. As many UK businesseshad to close and put workers on the government’s furlough scheme, it is perhapsnot surprising that the pandemic has led to a pause in recruitment. With theeconomic fallout of Covid-19 yet to be fully realised, it may be a while until manyﬁrms are ready to hire again. A KPMG and REC report on Jobs: South of England(https://www.business-live.co.uk/enterprise/jobs-market-on-pause-coronavirus-18060393)showed that the coronavirus pandemic resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in hiringacross the region in March 2020, with the fastest rate of reduction in over 11 years.Despite this, half (48%) of companies in our survey were still recruiting for dataroles. Some ﬁrms that continued to advertise vacancies during the pandemic foundthat fewer people were applying, or that people were not willing to move duringlockdown. However, the most commonly cited reasons for difﬁculties in recruitmentare the longer-standing issues of ﬁnancial cost and a lack of the right talent.
Many students aren’t clear on how to become a data scientist
It is also important to look at barriers from the perspective of the people who will ﬁllthese roles. Students are one key source of recruitment. In our survey of students,half (49%) of those in higher education or training felt that the training or educationpath to become a data scientist is clear, while two ﬁfths (39%) thought it wasunclear, and one in eight (12%) were not sure.
Lack of clarity is higher among certain demographics. Regionally, the lack of clarityis highest in Scotland (48%), the South East and South West (44%). Females aremore likely than males to say that the path is unclear (43% compared to 34%).Younger students are also more likely to be unclear (49% of those aged under 21vs. 31% of those over 21). In line with this, undergraduates (44%) are more likely tofeel unclear than Master’s and PhD students (38% and 26% respectively).Meanwhile, almost a third (32%) of apprentices felt unclear, as did over a third(37%) of BTEC students. It is apparent that an awareness gap exists. This gap

needs to be addressed when informing students about education and careerchoices that could lead to a future career in data related roles.
Of those students who said that the path to becoming a data scientist was unclearto them or they were not sure, two in ﬁve (39%) had not sought advice to guidethem on this, while three in ﬁve (61%) had. Students sought guidance from a rangeof sources. These include the internet (39%), speaking to careers advisors atuniversity (15%), and speaking to university staff (15%). This suggests that there ismore that could be done to improve guidance on how best to pursue a data relatedcareer.
Figure 11. Chosen channels of information about the path to becoming a datascientist – among businesses who feel unclear about it
Speciﬁc demographics are more likely to seek advice than others. Males who areunclear or unsure about the path to becoming a data scientist are more likely toseek information than their female counterparts (68% of males vs 56% of females).
As well as being the region with the lowest level of clarity, those in Scotland arealso less likely to seek information than other regions (47% in Scotland, comparedto averages of 60%+ in other regions). Ethnic minorities are also more likely toseek information than those from a white background (71% vs 56% respectively).Those from social backgrounds C2DE are also more likely to seek information thanthose from ABC1 (67% vs. 56% respectively).
Across all types of study, those who are unclear or unsure about the pathway tobecome a data scientist are most likely to turn to the internet for more clarity. Thosestudying for a Master’s degree are more likely to turn to a careers advisor at theiruniversity for guidance (21%) than those at an Undergraduate level (14%).
Summary and implications
There are between 178,000-234,000 data roles in the UK that businessesare currently being recruited for, depending on whether a broad or narrowdeﬁnition of “data skills” is used. However, many companies have found itdifﬁcult to ﬁll these roles, with ﬁnancial costs and a lack of the rightcombination of skills being key reasons.Furthermore, many students do not feel that there is a clear pathway tobecoming a data scientist, even when they have sought guidance.Togetherthese act as barriers to UK businesses building efﬁcient data capabilities,which in turn adversely impacts on their performance and decision making.

Quantifying the UK Data Skills Gap - Full report - GOV.UK
A review of curriculum content and mathematical literacy demonstrates the need forrapid change to ensure a “fully data-literate population”. Despite the UK’s well-developed economy, the country is frequently positioned mid-rank in mathematicalskills – alarmingly, the numeracy skills of 75% of Britons aged 16-65 may preventthem from comparative price analysis of products and services, as well ashousehold budgeting.[footnote 39] Unlike our higher performing peers, researchindicates that the UK does not place quantitative skills at the core of curriculumcontent. In tertiary education speciﬁcally, researchers highlight non-standard skillsin statistics from comparable degrees across institutions. This creates adisempowered graduate workforce, who lack conﬁdence in the application of theseskills, with troubling implications for business productivity. Arguably, this may beexacerbated by an under-skilled management population within the workforce, as58% of people in “higher managerial and professional” occupations were found notto have numeracy skills above level 2.[footnote 40]
Student conﬁdence
Many students (45%) surveyed did not feel well-equipped to carry out future dataroles when they enter or re-enter the workplace. This feeling was highest amongBTEC students (53%) and Foundation degree students (50%). However, a highproportion of apprentices (46%), undergraduates (46%) and Master’s studentsshared this perspective (44%). Those pursuing a PhD were some of the least likelyto concur (39%).
Over a third (35%) of workers in our survey said that their data skills left themfeeling ill-equipped to perform their current role. Younger workers are more likely tofeel a similar way than older workers (38% of 18-34 year olds vs. 36% of 35-54year olds vs. 31% of those aged 55+). Workers in medium (38%) and large (37%)businesses were also more likely to agree compared to workers in micro (32%) orsmall (34%) businesses. Interestingly, senior members of staff were also morelikely to say they did not feel well-equipped, in comparison with staff occupyingmore junior positions. Half (49%) of senior managers and directors did not feel well-equipped, compared to almost two ﬁfths of middle managers (39%) and juniormanagers or supervisors (37%) and a third (34%) of executive workers with nomanagerial responsibility. Ethnic minorities (42%) reported higher levels of notfeeling well-equipped than workers from a white background (35%).
When asked about the future,over a third (35%) of workers stated that they do notfeel well equipped with data skills to perform their role over the next ﬁve years.
Measuring the data skills gap
We focused on two metrics in our survey to measure the supply, demand and thedata skills gap in the UK: Importance and Performance.
Employers in our survey evaluated how important each skill, that makes up ourdeﬁnition of data skills, is to the business’ day-to-day functioning and evaluatedhow their organisation performs for each skill at an organisation/team level.

Quantifying the UK Data Skills Gap - Full report - GOV.UK
The employers answered the question for each skill on a 4-point scale, rangingfrom ‘Not at all important’ to ‘Very important’ with an optional ‘Don’t know’ opt-out.The points ‘Very important’ and ‘Somewhat important’ were then added together torepresent Importance.
The Performance question asked employers across the UK to evaluate how theirorganisation performs at each skill at an organisation/team level. The employersanswered each skill question on a 5-point scale, ranging from ‘Very poor’ to‘Excellent’ with two opt-outs: ‘Don’t know’ and ‘NA / Not applicable for ourorganisation’. We used the latter to exclude those to whom a particular skill was notapplicable from the Performance calculation for that particular skill, so as not tojudge a company on a skill that does not apply to them. The points for ‘Excellent’and ‘Good’ were then added together to represent Performance.
From this, we have created three measures. The Importance measure shows theaverage importance of all skills for employers– which may vary across regions,industries and business sizes.
The Performance measure represents the average (mean) performance of all skillsfor employers. The data skills gap is a measure where Performance is subtractedfrom Importance. This shows the perception gap between Importance andPerformance to show where gaps exist in the relative Importance and relativePerformance of each skill.
We take a look at variations in the three measures by region, industry and businesssize below.
NB: The industries shown below were selected due to having a large enough basesize to be reported on.
The data skills’ Importance, Performance, and gapmeasures by region
When we look at Importance by region, it is clear that the importance of data skillsis in line with national needs in regions like the North West, Yorkshire and theHumber, East Midlands, West Midlands, South East, South West, Wales andScotland. However, data skills are less important in the East of England which hasan Importance measure of 70%. London sees a marginally higher need for dataskills with an Importance measure of 86%, as does Northern Ireland (85%, note thelow base size).
Figure 12. Percentage of employers saying that data skills are very orsomewhat important to their company – by region
When we look at Performance by region, the picture is different. While the NorthWest, Yorkshire and the Humber, South West, North East and Scotland are in linewith the national average, data skills performance differs across the other regions.The West Midlands, Wales, Northern Ireland and London have the highestpercentages. The East Midlands, East of England and South East regions seerelatively worse performance than the national average.

Figure 13. Percentage of employers saying that data skills are performed veryor somewhat well in their company – by region
Putting these data points together, we can see that when we account forImportance and Performance in each region, the size of the data skills gap variesacross regions. At the lower end, regions such as the North West, Yorkshire andthe Humber, West Midlands, South West, Wales and Northern Ireland have a smalldata skills gap. At the higher end, the East Midlands seems to suffer from the mostsigniﬁcant data skills gap in the UK, followed by the South East, North East andLondon.

Data skills Importance, Performance, and gap measures byindustry
When we look at the Importance measure by industry, the difference betweenindustries is relatively small. Only Computer Services, Hardware and Software andManufacturing sectors stand out as having a larger need for data skills than otherindustries.
Figure 15. Percentage of employers saying that data skills are very orsomewhat important to their company – by industry
When we look at the Performance measure by industry, Manufacturing has thehighest Performance measure (75%), followed by Banking and Retail (both 72%).
Figure 16. Percentage of employers saying that data skills are performed veryor somewhat well in their company – by industry
Putting these data points together, we can see that when we account forImportance and Performance in each industry, the size of the data skills gap ismore varied. At the lower end, industries such as Banking and Retail have asmaller data skills gap, while the size of the gap in Computers, Education andManufacturing suggests that these industries would beneﬁt from increasedinvestment in data skills training or hiring.

When we look at the Performance measure by business size, we see thatPerformance is lower for small businesses relative to larger businesses.
Figure 19. Percentage of employers saying that data skills are performed veryor somewhat well in their company – by business size
Putting these data points together, we can see that when we account forImportance and Performance, micro businesses have a negative measure – this isbecause Performance in micro businesses is higher than the importance of eachskill. On the other hand, small and medium businesses have quite a large gap indata skills.

Exploring the relative Importance and Performance ofindividual skills
Looking at the different skills individually, the top 5 skills that have the biggest gapbetween Importance and Performance (as indicated by UK employers) are‘Information management’, ‘Communication’, ‘Data communication skills’,‘Knowledge of emerging technologies and solutions’ and ‘Data literacy’. These top5 skills are a mix of soft (e.g. ‘Communication’) and hard (e.g. ‘Informationmanagement’) skills, indicated below in pink and green respectively.

The gap for the top 3 soft skills is driven by different company sizes, sectors andindustries. For example, the gap for ‘communication’ is larger in medium sizedbusinesses (23%) and those in the public sector (24%) and local government(29%), compared to the UK average (18%). ‘Communication’ was also seen to belacking more in the education industry (25%), as well as computer services,software and hardware (29%).
Looking at ‘adaptability’, the gap between Importance and Performance was seenmore in medium sized businesses (22%), local government (27%) andmanufacturing (29%), compared to the UK average of 16%.
Finally, the gap for ‘analytical mindset’ was most strongly felt in small businesses(26%) and education (27%), compared to the UK average of 16%.

Looking at individual workers’ capabilities, there is consistently a much larger gapfor hard data skills in comparison to soft data skills. Focusing on those who seeeach skill as relevant to their job, ‘basic IT skills’ and ‘machine learning’ are coveredfairly well. However, UK workers feel they could perform better on ‘programming’,‘knowledge of emerging technologies and solutions’, and ‘advanced statistics’, withthese three skills having the biggest gap between employers’ expectations andworkers’ individual Performance.

Base: 1,000 UK students
When asked what skills graduates lack the most, employers say that about aquarter of graduates join their organisation with a lack of ‘leadership’,‘communication’, ‘critical thinking skills’ and ‘professionalism’, with a ﬁfth of non-graduate new joiners also lacking ‘problem-solving abilities’. This is supported byhow students see themselves, as similar numbers rate their Performance in theseskills as only adequate or worse.
However, it’s important to note that, while employers consider many of these skillsto be important, they do not necessarily expect graduates to perform at a high level.There are some skills (highlighted below) where students judge themselves moreharshly than employers, such as ‘project management’, ‘industry/sector expertise’,‘subject matter expertise’ and having an ‘analytical mindset’. For example, morethan a quarter (27%) of students predict they will only be adequate or worse athaving an ‘analytical mindset’ after their studies. In contrast, only one in eight (13%)employers say graduates lack this skill.

‘Programming’, ‘database management’ and ‘data ethics’ top the list ofmost underdeveloped hard data skills with students
There is a clear general underperformance amongst students’ hard skills. However,the top 3 biggest gaps between Importance and students’ Future performance lie in‘programming’ (20% gap), ‘database management’ (19%) and ‘data ethics’ (19%)skills. As students make up a large proportion of the supply pipeline of data skills,it’s unsurprising that employers identify these gaps in both their data teams andindividual workers.
At the bottom of the table, only two hard skills see a gap of 10% or less: data‘visualisation’ and ‘machine learning’ – however, the latter is a hard skill that alsohas the lowest importance to UK employers because it is a highly specialist skill.

Students expect their studies to signiﬁcantly improve their hard dataskills – expected improvements on soft skills are smaller
The development of students’ skills may be negatively affected by the level ofexpectation that students have of their studies or training. With some skills,students expect large leaps in the improvement of their performance: for example,over two ﬁfths (45%) of students rate their ‘industry/sector expertise’ as currentlyexcellent/good, while over two thirds (68%) expect to be excellent/good at this skillat the end of their studies, meaning that there is an expectation in improvementfrom 23% of students. In particular, over one in six (18%) students feel theycurrently have excellent ‘subject matter expertise’, while over a third (35%) believethey will have excellent ‘subject matter expertise’ after ﬁnishing their studies.

is a similar story regarding ‘industry/sector expertise’, with one in eight (13%)students feeling they are proﬁcient now, and 30% expecting that they will beproﬁcient at the end of their studies.
Students also have high expectations for their hard data skills, with more than halfexpecting to be good or excellent at ‘advanced statistics’, ‘data visualisation’,‘machine learning’ and ‘knowledge of emerging technologies’. Students who expectto be good at these skills in the future are more likely to be studying Accounting &Finance, Aeronautical & Manufacturing Engineering or Economics. They are alsosigniﬁcantly more likely to have received hard data skills training in their studies.Furthermore, those who expect to be good or excellent at machine learning aremore likely to be in a further year of study (4th year and beyond).
Regionally, students from London are more likely to expect stronger hard data skillsat the end of their studies – they are also more likely to expect this if they intend towork in London after their studies.
Looking at students’ future choice of industry, those who expect to possessstronger hard data skills in the future are generally seeking to go into Banking &Financial Services, Engineering and Chemistry.
In particular, those who expect good machine learning skills are more likely to beseeking to go into Advertising & Marketing or Aerospace/Aviation. They are alsomore likely to be relatively certain of their future choice of career. However,expectations around most soft skills are smaller amongst these students. When itcomes to ‘problem-solving’, ‘professionalism’, ‘curiosity’, ‘communication’ and‘adaptability’, students believe that their performance won’t see much of a changebetween now and after their studies – potentially due to these skills’ more abstractnature.

Base: 1,000 UK students
It is important to note that a signiﬁcant proportion of the student population does notyet know what industry or area of work they will be entering, with only a third (32%)being certain about their choice of career after ﬁnishing further education/training.Meanwhile, a third (34%) are quite uncertain or not certain at all about where theywant to work in the future, while another third (34%) say they have a good idea ofwhat they’re interested in, but have not yet narrowed it down.
Summary and implications
Overall, skills gaps exist across all soft skills, most notably for ‘communication’,‘adaptability’ and ‘critical thinking’, with UK workers lacking an ‘analytical mindset’and ‘project management’ skills. Without strong soft skills, there is a risk thatdata will be misread or miscommunicated, and some insight may be lost.Hard skills across companies are also lacking, particularly ‘informationmanagement’ and ‘knowledge of emerging technologies’. Individual workers lackstrong hard data skills, with their Performance of only ‘basic IT skills’ matchingthe demand from employers. When hard data skills are underdeveloped, teamsmay risk being unable to use their data to answer business questions,information might be mismanaged, and companies may miss opportunities touse data to improve their performance.Employers note a shortage of advanced hard skills at a sector level, such as‘machine learning’ and ‘advanced statistics’. These skills are often the “breadand butter” of some companies and sectors – when such skills are lacking, acompany may not function or provide its services to their full potential. As 80% ofthe 2030 workforce are already employed,[footnote 41] training of the existingworkforce will be crucial. However, as we will see in the next chapter, there aregaps in training.When it comes to employers’ expectations of graduates and other new joiners,‘industry’, ‘sector’, ‘subject matter expertise’ and an ‘analytical mindset’ presentthe biggest soft skills gaps. Meanwhile ‘programming’, ‘database management’and ‘data ethics’ top the list of most underdeveloped hard data skills for students.Students expect their studies to signiﬁcantly improve their hard data skills.Employers may therefore need to assess whether further training is needed toensure students have the hard skills needed to perform their jobs effectively.NB Employers, workers and students were asked to self-rate abilities. Thismeans that the data collected is based on individual perception. Theseperceptions are viable and important to collect, because perceptions inﬂuencedecisions, and because this acts as a useful calibration against employers’assessments of needs and capability (though we should once again caveat thatthese ratings are subjective).

Training and development
Training and development (how skills are being developed)
As data becomes an increasingly important commodity, recruiting trainedprofessionals and upskilling workers cost effectively (to increase overallproductivity) will be a primary concern for employers. Recent research conductedby the Open University estimates that the cost of remaining productive; increasingavailable salaries on offer, training those hired at lower levels, temporary stafﬁng,and associated recruitment costs totalled around £6.33 billion a year in 2018 alone.Additionally, three-in-ﬁve senior managers reported that the skills shortage inindustry had worsened between 2017 and 2018 (61%).[footnote 42]
Existing research has highlighted that university students are a key source of talentfor companies seeking data skills and employers often look to specialist subjectswhen recruiting new graduates. In the Nesta & RSS Model Workers report, amajority of companies preferred to recruit people from quantitative disciplines likestatistics, applied statistics, the physical sciences, computer sciences andengineering. They also looked for candidates with strong computing skills, includingcomputer programming, and database design and operation.[footnote 43] However,companies will need to look further than university students in these specialistsubjects to meet their supply needs, particularly given the competition for suchgraduates. The potential supply of data scientists from UK universities is unlikely tobe more than 10,000 per year, based on data on graduates from UK universitiesbetween 2017-2018. This is nowhere enough to meet the demand for workers withsufﬁcient data skills. Upskilling the existing workforce will therefore have to be a keypart of any strategy to meet the high and growing demand for data skills in the UK.
In this next section we look at what businesses are doing to train their existing staff,and what training students are currently accessing.
Three in ﬁve employers are conﬁdent in identifying and providing fortraining needs
Encouragingly, we found that employers report fairly positive attitudes to data skillstraining. Just over three in ﬁve (64%) employers say they are conﬁdent inidentifying skills gaps within their workforce, with a slightly smaller proportion ofemployers indicating that they are conﬁdent they know where to ﬁnd resources totrain their employers (57%).
More than half (56%) of employers indicated a preference to train professionalsinternally. This may be related to the high costs associated with recruiting dataprofessionals, as well as the shortage of external talent with the right data skills.Larger businesses are more likely to prefer upskilling their own workforce torecruiting new workers; three ﬁfths (59%) of large businesses (250+ employees)agreed with this, compared to just under half (48%) of micro businesses.

Figure 23. Employers’ attitudes towards data skills training
Figure 23B. Employers’ attitudes towards data skills training by sector (%Agree)
Figure 23C. Employers’ attitudes towards data skills training by business size(% Agree)
This level of conﬁdence also appears to be echoed by employees within theworkforce – more than half believe they have the adequate skills necessary for thefuture (56%) and are conﬁdent in identifying gaps in their teams’ training (55%).
Generally, employees and employers within the private sector or larger businessesreport slight increases in almost all statements presented.
Improving data skills is a medium priority across organisations – softskills are a higher priority
Presented with the same list of data skills, we asked employers to indicate whichskills their employees currently receive training for, and to indicate how high apriority[footnote 44] it is to improve these skills within their workforce.
Figure 24. Priority ranking of data skills employers seek to improve
Though existing training for hard data skills tends to be more prevalent acrossemployers, on average, we ﬁnd that improving soft skills is considered the highestpriority.
How can this apparent disconnect be explained? In 2018, Michael Li, who at thetime was Head of Analytics & Data Science at LinkedIn, detailed four key areas ofassessment for data professionals: data wrangling, experimental design, statisticalmodelling/ machine learning and soft skills. Within the ﬁrst three areas, he said thatthe professional needs rigid quantitative hard skills, identiﬁcation of programmingcapabilities and advanced statistical techniques relevant to the area a businessoperates in. However, when it comes to soft skills, the guidelines are moresubjective. For instance, the candidate would be assessed on the way that theycommunicate data and their past achievements(https://blogs.oracle.com/datascience/skills-that-linkedin-looks-for-in-a-data-scientist-candidate). This method of assessment for soft skills (compared to that described forhard skills) is more subjective in nature, and possibly leads to non-standard levelsof competencies in soft skills across a workforce.
Figure 25A. Data Skills training currently undertaken by workers (Top 10)
There appears to be a signiﬁcant overlap between the key areas of improvementidentiﬁed by employers and the training currently undertaken by employees. Aroundthree in ten (29%) graduates receive training for ‘basic IT skills’, with a quarter alsoreceiving training in ‘communication’ (25%), ‘leadership’ (25%), and ‘criticalthinking’ (25%).

Figure 25B. Data Skills training currently undertaken by students (Top 10)
As Higher Education institutions and other providers create more courses in datascience (and associated technologies), it is vital that new curricula offer studentsthe ability to learn both hard and soft skills. Concerns have been raised that thedevelopment of soft skills may have suffered with remote learning and lack of workplacement opportunities during the pandemic. (https://www.ncub.co.uk/blog/who-will-take-responsibility-for-the-soft-skills)
Training for “soft” skills tends to be more difﬁcult to ﬁnd
Of the skills presented in the survey, employers were then asked to consider whichskills are hardest to ﬁnd training for. Though there are marginal differencesbetween those reporting difﬁculties across any given skill, softer skills ranked thehighest (‘Critical thinking’ 13%, ‘Leadership’ 12%), achieving a higher averagescore vs hard skills amongst employers.
Figure 26. Most difﬁcult data skills to ﬁnd training for (Top 10)
More than one in three (34%) employers reported no difﬁculty in sourcing trainingfor the data skills surveyed. Micro businesses (68%) are more likely to say theyhave no difﬁculty, with this dropping signiﬁcantly as business size increases (small44%, medium 27%, large 25%).
These ﬁndings prompt several questions for further analysis. How do smallerenterprises utilise data skills in their “typical” operations? Perhaps, due to a lack ofinternal resources, do smaller enterprises rely far more on internal knowledgetransfer to train employees? To further our understanding, we looked at barriers toimplementing training, examining speciﬁc differences across sectors and businesssizes.
Figure 27. Barriers to training and employment (employers)
Price is a considerable barrier, but relevance and practicality are alsoimportant
Figure 28. Biggest barriers to data-related training by sector and businesssize
High cost (29%), relevance to organisation (25%) and practical relevance for theindividual’s day job (23%) are the main concerns amongst employers surveyed.These barriers are consistent across sectors. There are however notabledifferences in the case of third sector employees, where concerns around cost risesigniﬁcantly (40%), in addition to concerns around relevancy (32%). Similarly, thesame trends apply across business sizes – concerns around cost rise signiﬁcantlyamong small enterprises, classiﬁed as 10-49 employees, (36%).

Beyond these three key concerns, employers also identiﬁed a disinterest amongtech workers and the need for more bespoke training sessions:
“[There’s] a lack of interest in softer skills by those in technology jobs”- Middlemanager in the training and development industry, working within the private sector
“[There’s] a lack of training that ﬁts in with fast paced changing demands” - Partnerin the automotive industry, working within the private sector.
Figure 29. Barriers to data skills training (students)
Students cited cost as the biggest barrier to acquiring data skills training, followedby a lack of knowledge of where to go for this training. Three in ten (30%) are alsonot sure of the types of skills they need training in.
There were some differences depending on gender. Females were more likely thanmales to say that cost (42% vs 37% respectively) was a barrier, that they did notknow where to get this training (37% vs 33% respectively) and that they did nothave time to participate in training (24% vs 18% respectively). Cost being a barrierwas highest among PhD students (56%) and lowest among apprentices (25%).Meanwhile, undergraduates (38%) and master’s students (36%) were more likelythan PhD students (30%) to say that they did not know where to go for training.
When workers are asked about the ways in which the use of data skills has addedvalue to their job, the issue of relevancy is again mentioned. Though a quarter(25%) of workers say that data skills training has improved their efﬁciency and onein ﬁve (19%) cite productivity improvements, just under half (48%) of all workerssay that the data skills training they have received has not added any signiﬁcantvalue to their daily operations.
Figure 30. According to workers - ways data skills have added value to theirjobs
Types of training undertaken
Over half (56%) of businesses surveyed said that their organisation preferred todevelop data skills internally, rather than outsource or recruit new workers withthese skills. This training is being provided through a mixture of methods. Half(49%) of businesses were providing in-house training, while a similar proportion(47%) were utilising external training to upskill their workforce in data skills.
There was also a mixture of online and in-person training. Two in ﬁve (41%)businesses made use of online courses such as webinars, and one in ﬁve (21%)used online communities, while one in three (33%) sent staff to attend meetups andevents. A smaller proportion used more formal academic training; only one in seven(14%) businesses sent their staff to university-taught programmes, while one infourteen (7%) utilised continuing professional development (CPD).
In recent research, three ﬁfths (61%) of business leaders identiﬁed the use of theapprenticeship levy as a key route to closing the skills gap over the next threeyears (while noting some preliminary issues in the implementation of the new

apprentice system, and also expressing concerns about the lack of ﬂexibility in theuse of the apprenticeship levy).[footnote 45]
Figure 31. Ways in which data skills training was delivered
There are some demographic differences in companies that conduct in-housetraining versus those that do not. The companies that conduct in-house training aresigniﬁcantly more likely to be large (250+ employees), and signiﬁcantly less likely tobe micro companies. The companies that conduct internal training are also morelikely to be in the Banking & Financial Services and Education sectors. Thesecompanies are also signiﬁcantly more likely to have someone at board levelresponsible for data. Roles they have struggled to recruit for include C-suite roles,Head of Data, Data Director, Data Analyst/Scientist/Technician/Engineer, MachineLearning Engineer, AI Director/Specialist or Intelligence Analyst. Finally, they aresigniﬁcantly more likely to require hard data skills, and signiﬁcantly less likely to notneed any data skills at all (hard or soft).
Half of employees have not received any data skills training within the lasttwo years
Half (51%) of workers surveyed have not undertaken any data skills related trainingin the last two years. There is a correlation between business size and receivingdata skills training. Two in three (64%) workers in micro businesses had notreceived any data skills training in the last two years, compared to over half (55%)of workers from small businesses, and just under half of those from medium sized(47%) and large (46%) businesses. There was also an age correlation. Olderworkers were more likely to have not had any data skills training in the last twoyears; two thirds (64%) of those aged 55+ have not had any training, comparedwith half (52%) of those aged 35-54 and over a third (36%) of those aged 18-34.This is a concern as regular training, regardless of age, is important to keep up todate with the latest developments, and to refresh knowledge. Additionally,employees want training; seven in ten (70%) workers are interested in seeking outdata skills training and just under half (46%) say the need for them to have dataskills has increased over the past ﬁve years. Unfortunately, however, this is notcurrently translating into high levels of training provision.
Of the skills training received, ‘IT training’ ranked the highest with almost one in six(15%) workers participating in this form of training. This was followed by training on‘communication’ (13%), ‘problem solving’ (11%) and ‘leadership’ (10%).
The main motivations for workers seeking data skills training were to staycompetitive and progress in their career. Just under three in ten are driven bykeeping pace with the changing requirements of their role (28%), while a quartercited career advancement (24%), and a comparable portion are seeking to diversifytheir skillset (22%). A quarter of workers cite their own personal interests as a keydriver (25%), but at the same time three in ten report they are not at all interested indata skills training.

These ﬁndings alongside concerns raised by employers around practicality andrelevance,suggest more can be done to contextualise available skills training foremployees and to communicate the importance of data skills when preparing forthe future.
Figure 33. Students’ motivations to seek data skills training
The top three motivators for students seeking data skills training are improvinggeneral career prospects (37%), personal interest (36%) and diversifying their skillsset (32%). Encouragingly, only one in ten (9%) students said they had no interest inseeking out data skills training. Women were more likely than men to say thatimproving their general career prospects is a motivator for seeking data skillstraining (43% vs 31% respectively). The top motivation for those in theC2DE[footnote 46] social grades was personal interest (39%), as opposed to ABC1students’ topmost motivation being to improve their general career prospects(42%). Similarly, those from an ethnic minority background were also most likely tocite personal interest (40%) as a motivator, while those from a white backgroundwere most likely to cite improving career prospects (37%) as their motivation.
Most businesses are positive about having the skills they need
Figure 34. Employers’ overall assessment of data skills and preparedness
Figure 34B. Employers’ assessment of data skills and preparedness bysector (% Agree)
Figure 34C. Employers’ assessment of data skills and preparedness bybusiness size (% Agree)
In a fast-paced world, the skills that organisations require are constantly changing.Half (47%) of businesses we surveyed mentioned that the skillset for theirorganisation has completely changed compared to ﬁve years ago. Data skills are akey area of change, with almost three ﬁfths (58%) of businesses mentioning thatdata is both seen to be a team effort, and a critical asset for every part of theirorganisation. A similar proportion (54%) stated that decision makers in theirorganisation appreciate the importance of data skills.
Overall, most businesses (58%) agree that their organisation has sufﬁcient dataskills to meet their current needs, while one in seven (14%) disagree. It isinteresting that a large number of micro businesses (66%) feel their organisationhas sufﬁcient data skills to meet their current needs, despite most micro businesses(64%) not having provided data skills training to their employees in the last twoyears. There is also conﬁdence in the future; three ﬁfths (59%) of businessessurveyed thought their organisation has the data skills necessary to succeed in thefuture, while one in ﬁve (19%) disagreed. Across the board, agreement on thesestatements was higher amongst private sector organisations than public sectororganisations. For instance, almost two thirds (63%) of private sector organisationsthought that they had the necessary data skills to succeed in the future, comparedto half (49%) of public sector organisations. Those in private sector organisations

were also more likely to agree that decision makers in their organisationappreciated the importance of data skills, compared to those in public sectororganisations (56% vs 42% respectively).
Summary and implications
There are apparent contradictions in the ﬁndings relating to training. Despitehalf (48%) of companies actively seeking new recruits with data skills,employers report high levels of conﬁdence with both employees current dataskills, and their ability to identify knowledge gaps within their currentworkforce. The main concern among employers seeking skills training iscost, but the high proportion of employers opting for in-house knowledgesharing conveys that some necessary steps are being taken to upskillworkers at an efﬁcient cost.Yet strikingly, half of all workers surveyed reported no data skills trainingwithin the last two years, and sizeable proportions reported a complete lackof interest. While noting that two in three (64%) workers in micro businesseshad not received any data skills training in the last 2 years, companies reportlittle difﬁculty in sourcing data skills training. It is also concerning that bothemployers and employees agree that the training offered to them does notseem relevant for their jobs or wider business needs.Three in ﬁve (60%) workers who have not received any data skills trainingsaid data skills do not add any signiﬁcant value, compared to a ﬁfth (19%) ofthose who have received this type of training. This suggests that those thatdo receive training are signiﬁcantly more likely to see the value of data skillsin their job.Much more could be done by employers, particularly senior managers andCEOs, in stressing the importance of all aspects of data skills training, bothfor employees’ day-to-day work, and their future career prospects in the fastchanging work environment. Educators and private training companies alsohave a critical role to play in shaping curricula that are up to date, dynamicand relevant, whilst also offering a diversity of training options catering tothose at lower price points.
Conclusions/observationsThis research has identiﬁed signiﬁcant demand for data skills in the UK workplace,which corroborates previous studies commissioned by the Royal Society andDCMS.(https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/ﬁle/807830/No_Longer_Optional_Employer_Demand_for_Digital_Skills.pdf). There arebetween 178,000-234,000 data related roles in UK companies to be ﬁlled, but theUK’s ability to meet this demand remains a concern, particularly in the short term.

universities is unlikely to be more than 10,000 per year, based on data ongraduates from UK universities between 2017-2018. While these ﬁndings aretentative, recognising that data science related undergraduate and postgraduatecourses are relatively few but growing in number, the potential supply issigniﬁcantly below the number of roles to be ﬁlled. As outlined by the Royal Societyand DCMS commissioned studies, demand for data skills is also rising quickly.Some of the rising demand will undoubtedly be driven by emerging technologiessuch as artiﬁcial intelligence or driverless cars.
Companies have told us they’ve found it challenging to ﬁll data roles in the past twoyears, with ﬁnancial costs and a lack of talent with the right skills combinationsbeing the biggest barriers. There also appears to be a knowledge/communicationgap that could pose a barrier to fulﬁlling this demand. Many students told us thatthey do not feel clear about the path to becoming a data scientist, even whenthey’ve sought guidance.
Given the limited supply of graduates likely to ﬁll data roles, upskilling the workforceis vital to bridging the data skills gap. Strikingly, half of all workers surveyedreported no data skills training within the last two years, and sizeable proportionsreported a complete lack of interest. There is however a correlation between thosethat receive training and their perceptions of data skills; those that have receiveddata skills training are much more likely to say that data skills add signiﬁcant valuein their job.
Interestingly, universities were not seen as a signiﬁcant source of training bybusinesses; only one in seven (14%) businesses who have sent employees to dataskills training in the last two years have put them through university taughtprogrammes, and only one in fourteen (7%) have sent their employees to CPDcourses at a university. Most internal training is happening either in-house, viaprivate training companies, or through online programmes (e.g. webinars).
There is a need to develop a suite of skills across both hard and soft skills. Overall,skills gaps exist across all soft skills, most notably for ‘communication’, ‘adaptability’and ‘critical thinking’, with UK employers reporting insufﬁcient ‘analytical mindset’and ‘project management’ skills. These soft skills are hugely important; withoutthem there is the potential for data to be misread or miscommunicated, which canhave signiﬁcant implications for businesses and the decisions they make. Theseskills could be developed through measures such as encouraging work experiencefor all undergraduates in the course of their studies.
Hard data skills across companies are also lacking, particularly ‘informationmanagement’ and ‘knowledge of emerging technologies’. Individual workers lackgood hard data skills, with their Performance of only ‘basic IT skills’ matching thedemand from employers. This underdevelopment of hard skills in data teamsmakes it more difﬁcult for companies to conﬁdently use data to answer businessquestions, and adds to the risk of information being mismanaged.
Education and training providers have a critical role to play in shaping curricula thatlooks to address these particular skill gaps and to offer a diversity of trainingoptions that also cater to those at lower price points.

Quantifying the UK Data Skills Gap - Full report - GOV.UK
Methodology
To understand the data skills gap in the UK, we conducted an online survey among1,045 UK businesses, 5,000 UK workers and 1,000 students in higher education ortraining in the UK. No weighting was applied.
To quantify the demand for data skills, within our survey we asked UK businesseshow many roles requiring data skills they were hiring for. They entered the numberin a numerical text box. In our analysis we looked at the median value for eachbusiness size (micro, small, medium and large) and multiplied it by the number ofbusinesses in the UK within that size bracket. We then added up the total grossedup ﬁgure for micro, small, medium and large businesses to arrive at our ﬁnalﬁgures.
To come to each of the calculations for population size, the median for eachbusiness size (micro, small, medium, large) was applied rather than the mean, asthe median reduces the extremes of the larger ﬁgures we see with the mean. Fromthe median, we grossed up for each business size, and then added these togetherto come to the overall ﬁgures. Once we got to the last 2 narrow deﬁnitions(recruiting for speciﬁc data specialist roles and businesses that require ‘hard’ dataskills), only 12 micro businesses from our sample were included. The median forthe 12 was 1 role, however we kept the median to 0 rather than 1 as the small basesize had a larger margin of error and would have inﬂated numbers for microbusinesses as a whole.
Appendix
NB: Industries shown here are those that had a large enough base size to bereported on.
Banking and Financial Services
Companies in the Banking and Financial Services sectors are signiﬁcantly morelikely to have existing data roles compared to other industries. More than half (52%)have an existing Data Analyst role, followed by 42% who employ a ChiefTechnology Ofﬁcer and 41% have existing Data Managers. Banking companies arealso signiﬁcantly less likely to have no data roles at all, with only 10% having nodata roles compared to the industry average of 22%.
The importance of ‘machine learning’ in Banking & Financial Services issigniﬁcantly higher than in other industries. This is reﬂected in the prevalence of‘machine learning’ specialists and engineers, as this industry employs almost twiceas many people in these roles compared to other industries.
Performance is higher than the average across industries in the following skills:‘analytical mindset’, ‘communication’, ‘data literacy’, ‘analysis skills’ and ‘dataethics’.

Based on 107 companies and 263 workers in the Banking and Financial Servicessector.
Demographic considerations: the Banking companies Opinium surveyed were morelikely than other industries to have 25,000+ employees (10% vs. 4%). This may bea contributing factor to the differences between this industry and other industries.
Computer Services, Hardware and Software
Companies in the Computer Services, Hardware and Software sector (hereafterComputer Services) are signiﬁcantly more likely to have some existing data rolescompared to other industries. Four-in-ten (41%) computer companies have anexisting Chief Information Ofﬁcer role, followed by 24% who employ a DataArchitect or Developer, and 24% with an existing Data Director role. Computercompanies are also signiﬁcantly less likely to have no data roles at all (4%).
The importance of different professional skills in Computer Services is generallyhigher, than in other industries, for ‘database management’, ‘analysis skills’, ‘dataliteracy,’ ‘knowledge of emerging technologies and solutions’ and other skills, whichis unsurprising considering the focus on data in this industry.
