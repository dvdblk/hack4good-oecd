Moving forward
This vision for the skills system is a long-term project. The starting point is ensuring that
short-term strategic priorities are approached as a step in the right direction towards longer-term
change. Focus now and in the first five years will be on the following short-term priorities:

five-year terms that will form part of the wider Economic Growth Strategy. Detailed action plans
will be developed and agreed for each Local Authority, addressing short-term priorities in such a
way that action will move forward the process of delivering the long-term vision.
These action plans will consider:
Stages of short-term
priorities
• Things already in motion - activities/interventions which are funded, approved and are either already being delivered or which will be delivered over the next five years.
• Things needed in the future - activities/interventions which are needed to underpin longer term and future development/growth, for which additional exploration, investment and potential
system change will be required.
Together partners across the area also need to start preparing the ground now for some bigger
change projects that the vision calls for. Some of these can be contributed to by shorter-term
projects, but they will need further scoping and iterative development to ensure all partners and
stakeholders are brought along the change journey.
Three change projects have been identified to ensure effective provision is delivered using an agile approach, in a way suited to the nuances of places:
1. A regional curriculum enabling strategic collaboration amongst providers, with learning and
training aligned to regional job opportunities and careers.
2. A dual-track skills and training system, anticipating long-term needs and responding with
agility in the short-term.
3. A coordinated place-based action framework, to engage all stakeholders in addressing
multiple/complex issues.
Cutting across all of these will be ongoing the action of Combined Authority, Local Authorities and the Cambridge and Peterborough Integrated Care System to work together, and with wider
partners, to place health and wellbeing at the centre of system development and delivery.

the area. Learners and employers are at the core, as the drivers of skills demand, with providers

skills, will be aligned to themes, in layers that will ripple out to deliver on short-term priorities and
long-term outcomes.

2. Where we are now Population trends
The result of health inequalities across the area (a domain in the Index of Multiple Deprivation)
is demonstrated in healthy life expectancy. There are stark differences between local authorities
and the communities within them. For instance, in Cambridge healthy life expectancy ranges
from 80.4 years in the most deprived communities to 85.2 years in the least deprived
communities (above national averages), and in Fenland the range is 73.1 to 77.5 years (below national averages). This compares to the England average of 75 to 82.8 years4.
Cambridgeshire and Peterborough is an area of more than 850,000 people, with population
centres in Peterborough and Cambridge, and much of the population living in surrounding rural
towns and villages. The CA area is growing, with population growth projected at 2.6% by 2040
This indicates that across the four themes and throughout people’s lives, inclusion will be an

one of the fastest growing cities in the UK in recent years.
Figure 7. Index of Multiple Deprivation: Health Domain, across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough (2019))
The working age population in the area is growing more slowly than average at just 0.1%,
compared with 1.5% growth nationally, suggesting faster future ageing. This trend is uneven
across the area. Only South Cambridgeshire has working age population growth above
average – at 2% compared with 1.5% across the UK. In Cambridge and Huntingdonshire the
working age population is falling, and faster than the overall projected population change by 2040 – by -3.4% and -0.3% respectively.2
In this part of England, there are fewer deprived areas than average – particularly in income,
employment and health. But there is inequality and there are disparities across the area – many
places experience very low levels of deprivation and offer good quality of life for residents, but deprivation is clustered in Fenland and Peterborough and with pockets in Cambridge.3

Progression rates at 18 vary by place. The following data reflects progression from schools in the individual local authority areas, not necessarily where students live. This caveat is most
visible in the data for South Cambridgeshire and Cambridge, where many of the students
progressing from school in Cambridge to university may live in South Cambridgeshire. The
lowest rates for progressing into HE are in South Cambridgeshire at 20.5% and East
Cambridgeshire at 25.4% compared with the highest at 41.2% in Cambridge and 35.6% in
Huntingdonshire. The lowest progression rates into FE at 18 in the area are in Cambridge at
2.8% and Fenland at 4.1%, compared with the highest at 8.3% in Peterborough and 9.8% in
South Cambridgeshire. There is higher than average progression into apprenticeships in East Cambridgeshire at 11.4%, Fenland at 10.7%, and South Cambridgeshire at 10%6.
Fewer pupils are studying vocational courses aged 16-18 – with falls in every Cambridgeshire district area, but only by -1% in East Cambridgeshire compared with -25% in
South Cambridgeshire and -23% in Cambridge between 2016 and 2019. More students are

However, patchy engagement with post-16/18 education is exacerbated by education estate and physical and digital access cold-spots – notable in Fenland and East Cambridgeshire – and including connection and device access challenges for rural and deprived communities. This is an issue
Across the area, half of all apprenticeship starts are being taken up by adults aged 25+, with Peterborough and Cambridge both recording higher proportions of starts by people in this

There is large disparity in residents’ earnings across the area: Peterborough (with Fenland) has the lowest average earnings in the area, at £23,973 compared with £31,673 in Cambridge and South Cambridgeshire14. The impact of lower skill levels in places such as Fenland means that communities are struggling to benefit from the region’s growth, threatening

In Peterborough and The Fens, efforts to create new jobs in the area are intrinsically linked to efforts to raise local skill levels. Providing a place’s residents with access to higher-level skills ultimately has little or no effect on productivity or addressing local levelling up challenges without also stimulating the supply of higher value, good quality jobs for those residents to go into.

One way to provide good quality jobs in a place is to support an innovation ecosystem to develop. The innovation ecosystem utilises a knowledge engine, such as a university or Research Institute, to produce new research which is then disseminated through the ecosystem15. Local businesses which are part of the innovation ecosystem can apply the research to their own
processes or to customer solutions, raising local innovative activity, and with it, demand for

through inward investment and business growth, which are filled by higher-skilled residents,
ultimately leading to increased productivity and levelling up.
The region has been held back by a fragmented innovation ecosystem. To take part in or benefit from knowledge intensive growth, residents need local access to relevant education
pathways, aligned to available, high quality jobs. Without both the learning pathway and an
employment opportunity, residents will miss out on the benefits of growth.
The CPIER identified the needs for enhanced infrastructure to support innovation, which is being
delivered on through the development of ARU Peterborough. Expanding the reach of University of
Cambridge and research assets in the south of the area will also be a key part of this. The map
on the right shows through the example of concentrations in advanced manufacturing, the
opportunity for progressing innovation in these areas. This requires intervening strategically to
concurrently raise local skill levels, local demand for skilled workers and create new jobs.
The largest employed workforces proportionate to population in the area are in Huntingdonshire
and East Cambridgeshire, where earnings are above average levels – offering opportunities and quality of life. Clusters of employment in CPCA priority sectors are growing in life sciences in South Cambridgeshire and Cambridge, advanced manufacturing and digital in Peterborough
and Cambridge, and agritech in Huntingdonshire, East Cambridgeshire and Fenland. This
provides opportunities for residents to benefit from growth with the right skills provision and
support. However, priority sectors account for only 20% of total employment, and the CPCA
Local Economic Recovery Strategy emphasises additional focus on the hardest hit foundational
sectors that make up the bulk of employment.

High levels of self-employment in Fenland point to a strong entrepreneurial culture, but
Figure 12. Travel to work flows across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough and to surrounding areas (2011 census data) 17
this is the only place that has more people self-employed than employed in a sector prioritised for innovation based growth. Fenland’s self-employment rate is the only place above national average at 18.7% compared with 13%. This with low overall earnings in Fenland
indicates limited employment opportunities. Fenland, Peterborough and Huntingdonshire all have
lower recent increases in employment levels, closer to (or lower than) the national average than
the CPCA average, with much sharper increases in self-employment.
This indicates barriers into work, including lower jobs density levels and reinforces the importance of job creation, as well as training, as an important component of up-skilling in some areas. Fenland has the lowest jobs density at 0.68, and East Cambridgeshire at 0.74 and Huntingdonshire at 0.83 have lower jobs density than the national average of 0.87. Peterborough,
Cambridge and South Cambridgeshire’s jobs density is higher than average, and Cambridge and
South Cambridgeshire’s levels are above 1, meaning there are more jobs available than working
age populations.
Travel to work shows on the following map to the left net inflows to Peterborough and
Cambridge, and net outflows from Fenland, East Cambridgeshire, South Cambridgeshire and
Huntingdonshire. (This data should be caveated that it is based on 2011 census data but
demonstrates long-term trends). Fenland in particular is not well connected to jobs clustering in
Cambridge and South Cambridgeshire, reducing access to opportunities.
The below map to the right also shows that commuting out of the CPCA area is concentrated in
the surrounding areas, with links into London and other major cities, but particularly to the North
and east of Peterborough, Fenland, East Cambridgeshire and South Cambridgeshire, into
Lincolnshire, Norfolk and Suffolk.
This suggests two priorities – connecting people to places where jobs are concentrated, and
creating good jobs where connectivity is more limited.

The area is starting to fall behind the national average on higher level skills. The proportion of the working age population qualified up to level 3 is rising at 2.3% compared with a fall of 0.1%

a level 2 is also rising against a national fall, and qualifications at level 4+ are growing more
slowly than average.
Currently levels of higher skills are in line with the rest of the UK at 43% of the working age
population qualified at level 4+, but this rate is growing more slowly than averagel, and there is
large variation between places. Rates range from 60% of the working population in Cambridge to
27% in Fenland. Rates are rising fastest in Huntingdonshire at 6.7%. But in Fenland, Cambridge and East Cambridgeshire, rates are falling20.
The occupational structure varies significantly across the area. In Cambridge, 53% of residents are working in occupations at skill level 4 (jobs which typically require a degree or
equivalent period of relevant work experience), compared with just 14% in Fenland and with 31%
nationally. All areas have lower than average rates of level 3 workers. In Huntingdonshire,
Fenland, Peterborough and East Cambridgeshire, around 32% of the workforce is employed in
level 2 roles (in line with national averages). Fenland and Peterborough have much higher than
average level 1 workers – at 18.3% and 17% respectively compared with 9.2% nationally. Levels
reflect the five highest employing occupations across the area: sales and retail assistants,
administrative occupations, care workers and home carers, elementary storage occupations, and nurses21.
Across the area, population growth is outstripping jobs growth, with a recent -4.8% fall in employment levels against a 0.7% rise in working age population, indicating further future issues in residents finding job opportunities – particularly in Fenland19. Creating and growing good jobs across the area, sectors and businesses will be a priority for the CPCA Economic Growth
Across the area, the main skills gaps are in mid-level, skilled roles, those which require strong
work-related and/or technical training. Considering these skills needs, the lower occupational levels, and fall in employment levels, in places such as Fenland, a drive for increasing higher level skills alone will not address barriers facing residents and the structure of jobs and businesses22. There needs to also be a focus on growing local businesses, and creating and attracting new jobs to the area, particularly considering the higher likelihood of school leavers

Life-wide and lifelong learning and training
Figure 14. Proportion of jobs that will require upskilling to become green jobs25
With an ageing society, people will be working for longer and changing jobs more throughout their
careers. This reflects the need for ‘life-wide’ learning as well as ‘lifelong’, as careers are
becoming less and less linear, with people having a portfolio of jobs and experience throughout
their lives. Life-wide also reflects the ability for people to pursue learning in the community and
through life experiences outside of direct job-related, or formally delivered training.
This with changes facing the economy in the coming years will require a skills system that can
respond to local employer needs, and individuals’ ambitions and individual technical and soft skill
gaps. Currently, access to careers guidance and advice beyond an educational setting is lacking.
Enhanced life-wide and community learning, and personal development not specifically related to work, provided in a community setting would support this. In 2019/20, 17% of CPCA Adult Education Budget spending was allocated to community learning23, and the CA aims in the upcoming commissioning period to allocate 20% of funding to community learning.
Transitions between jobs, employers, occupations and roles will become more important as driving trends play out in the local economy. Industry 4.0 and automation, potentially accelerated by labour shortages currently being experienced from the effects of Covid-19 and
Brexit, are expected to impact priority sectors in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough. Agritech has
the highest exposure to automation at 49% of employment exposed, with 43.9% of employment
not overlapping with other priority sectors. Advanced manufacturing faces 39% of employment
exposure, with 33% for digital and 31% for life sciences. These four sectors also have more overlapping occupations in other sectors, ranging from 74.2% to 79.9%24. Reskilling will be a clear challenge in the coming years, particularly in areas with concentrations of agriculture and
Higher workplace training rates in Peterborough and Fenland (with 25.4% and 27.8% reporting receiving training in the last quarter, compared with 11.9% in Cambridge) demonstrate
that residents can, and do, access up to date work experience and skills – including digital, technical and soft skills - at work26. However, linked to lower progression from school into FE, HE, and apprenticeships, this also signals that pre-work education is leaving residents in these places with gaps in job related, technical, and/or soft skills that employers need, and there is a lack of range in the offer of work-related training from providers. The CPCA’s Adult Education Budget can therefore play a key role in work-related training based on employer needs.
manufacturing.
As we transition to net zero with national targets set by 2050, and with CPCA committing its own operations to becoming net zero by 2030, skills and recruitment needs will grow in order to decarbonise sectors. There are differences between places in the upskilling need to create green jobs. A concern is that those places with the most significant education-access cold spots
also have the potential to require the most green upskilling.
Learner participation in courses funded by CPCA’s Adult Education Budget grew from the first year of devolution in 2019/20, from 8,421 to 9,097, this is despite the disruption to learning caused by Covid-19. Courses with the most enrolments in 2020/2021 so far are health, public
services and care; preparation for life and work; and information and communication technology.

The CA will also lead the way on establishing three linked longer-term change projects that are critical to ensuring our skills system can truly meet
the needs of our local communities:
1. A regional curriculum enabling strategic collaboration across providers,
2. A dual-track system, anticipating long-term needs and responding with agility in the short-term – with providers who can both lead on future workforce
3. A coordinated place-based action framework, to engage all stakeholders in
with learning and training aligned to local job opportunities and careers – using robust data and information from employers
addressing multiple/complex issues – convening place leaders, providers, schools
development to provide a pipeline of talent
and partners to focus on improving skill and

opportunities and careers.
These three projects will ensure effective provision is delivered using an agile approach, in a way suited to the nuances of our places.
Cutting across all of these will be the commitment to inclusive growth and the ongoing action of CPCA, Local Authorities and Cambridge and
Peterborough Integrated Care System to work together, and with wider partners, to place health and wellbeing at the centre of system
development and delivery.

Moving forward in ourplaces
The vision, outcomes and short-term
priorities set out in the previous sections
present the collective ambitions and call to
action across Cambridgeshire and
Peterborough. These actions are relevant
on some level everywhere. However, as
demonstrated in the review of existing data,
moving forward requires action to take
account of the different starting points in
each of our places.
The following sections consider each Local
Authority in turn, recapping on the specific
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and
threats present in the local economies, prior
to setting out the nuance of the short-term
priorities given this local context and
corresponding initial actions are included.
Finally, each section suggests where
additional place-based indicators, above and
beyond those set out for the area as whole,
might be useful to track progress more
specifically.

Annex A: Progress measuresThe progress measures set out in Fig. 23 in section 3, and localised in the place pages in section 4 are displayed in the below scorecard. This shows each place’s relative position now on each indicator relating to the progress measures. In implementing this Employment and Skills Strategy and monitoring progress, the below can be updated in a dashboard to track progress. Each of the indicators is accessible in a nationally published dataset that is regularly updated.
Figure 26. Progress measures scorecard – current position on key indicators
Notes:
• School participation and NEET data is only collated at Upper Tier Local Authority level, and is therefore not available broken down by District in Cambridgeshire.
• Indicators for travel to work times are not included here as they are not regularly updated – these are based on 10-yearly census data. Indicators for vocational level study in Fenland and  connectivity investment are also not included here as they are produced locally within local authorities and the CPCA.
