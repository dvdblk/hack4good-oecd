Summary
Human capital – which we take to be synonymous with skills – is a good place to start
when looking to improve the UK’s labour market and economic performance. But the
nature of work has changed significantly in the past decades, demanding from workers
skills to perform new tasks and rendering other skills and corresponding tasks obsolete.
In particular, over the past 25 years, the need for social skills and abstract skills in the
workplace has increased at the same time as the employment shares of occupations
that are intensive in routine and manual skills have fallen. For example, occupations that
use social skills intensively (such as directorial positions in marketing and sales, human
resources, and customer services) have become a larger part of the set of jobs done in
the UK, whereas those that have little need for social skills have declined in importance.
Conversely, occupations that use routine skills intensively (such as metal workers,
assemblers, and plastic process operatives) have declined, whereas those that have little
need for manual skills have become more important.
Alongside these changes, wages have grown particularly strongly for jobs that require a
significant amount of abstract reasoning: occupations that use abstract skills intensively
(i.e. at the 90th percentile of abstract-skill-intensity across all occupations) have seen
average wage growth of 30 per cent since 1994, compared with wage growth of below 15
per cent for occupations that involve below-median levels of abstract skills. In general,
these shifts are relatively good news for workers with high levels of education and those
in high-paying occupations, as they are most likely to utilise social and abstract skills
while in the workplace.
Training, whether it be on-the-job or done outside of work, is the most salient pathway
by which one can acquire skills while in the labour market. But training is in decline: the
proportion of workers who report that they have received work-related training in the
past 3 months has fallen from 29 per cent in 2002 to 24 per cent in 2020, and has fallen
the most for workers aged under 25. The number of days training received per employee
or per trainee is lower than a decade ago, as are the proportion of employers who report
they are providing training and the amount of money spent on training by employers. The
most-educated workers train more, with an average of over 40 per cent reporting having
received some form of training in the previous quarter, twice as high a rate as those with
below secondary level education. Among adults who are out-of-work (both those who are
inactive and unemployed, but excluding those on parental leave), training rates are very
low: only 13 per cent received any training (in a 12-month period), less than half the rate at
which employees are trained. Fewer than one-in-ten out-of-work adults received longer
or qualification-bearing forms of training.

These low rates of training among the least educated are troubling, given international
evidence showing that there are higher returns to adult education for these individuals.
And the difficulty of acquiring new skills once one is already in the labour force is borne
out by worrying labour market trends. The UK has seen falling rates of job mobility in
recent decades, with much of the changing patterns of occupational structure driven by
entry and exit of workers as opposed to employed workers transitioning from declining
to expanding sectors. In a world of stagnant productivity growth and with an increasing
need for wages to keep pace with prices, improving the UK’s system of training and skills
provision could have an enormously beneficial impact. Fortunately, there is a wealth of
international evidence that can be drawn upon to design a system that would make post-
school training provision work for more of the UK’s labour force. Phase 2 of the Economy
2030 project will advance policy recommendations in this field that can ultimately
contribute to higher and more inclusive economic growth for the UK.
Introduction
Human capital – by which we mean the skills, knowledge and experience of the
workforce – should form part of any attempt to assess the strengths and weaknesses of
the UK economy, and so it is a key consideration for the Economy 2030 project, being
undertaken by the Resolution Foundation and the Centre for Economic Performance at the LSE.1
It is well-known that the UK has an unequal distribution of human capital, in the sense
that there is a relatively large proportion of adults with higher-level qualifications but
also a higher proportion of adults with very low qualification levels than in comparable
countries. According to OECD data, 38 per cent of working-age adults in England are
qualified to tertiary level (above the OECD average of 34 per cent), while 25 per cent have
below upper secondary level qualifications (slightly higher than the OECD average of
24 per cent). This is set out in Figure 1, which shows these figures for England, Northern
Ireland, and selected OECD countries. England stands out for having relatively few adults
with middle-level qualifications; recent work has found that this gap is related to the lack
of funding for advanced vocational qualifications, leaving UK adults a quarter as likely as adults from the US to have undertaken an advanced vocational qualification.2

In addition, the OECD data do not disaggregate education levels into the four categories used in the previous subsection; instead, vocational qualifications and degrees are combined into tertiary education.SOURCE: Figure 8 in C Farquharson, S McNally & I Tahir, ‘Education Inequalities’, IFS Deaton Review of Inequalities, August 2022.
There are at least two reasons why a desire to end the recent stagnation and inequality
that has characterised the UK economy should cause policy makers to focus on human
capital. One is that it can make an important contribution to economic growth, alongside
other inputs. An increase in educational quality is strongly associated with economic growth, even when taking account of initial levels of GDP and years of schooling.3 Another reason is the important role that human capital plays in shaping individuals’
life outcomes. In the labour market, an individual’s highest qualification has a strong
impact on employment and earnings over their working life. For example, among today’s
40-year-olds, those with at most GCSE-level qualifications have an employment rate 15
percentage points lower – and, if in work, earn 40 per cent less – than those with a degree or an equivalent level qualification.4
In this note, we focus on the skills of the UK workforce. We first show that recent changes
in the labour market mean that demand is rising for abstract and social tasks. This
suggests that these skills should form part of any expansion in training activity. Then

we zoom in on workplace training, and show that this is currently not responding to our
skills shortage in an appropriate way: the amount of training happening is falling, and it is
concentrated on workers with higher-level qualifications.
Jobs requiring abstract and social tasks have increased in the UK labour market, at the expense of those involving routine and manual tasks
Like many developed countries, the UK has undergone structural change in recent
decades. Not only has there been a secular decline in manufacturing, but the increased
use of information technology and offshoring have meant that the tasks performed, and skills utilised, by the labour force have also changed.5 Below, we provide an overview of how skills used to perform different tasks has changed in the UK labour market between
1994 and 2018; Box 1 explains some methodological points.

used to perform different tasks, we
although often performed by very

different workers, are less amenable to computerization.8 We also considered how the utilisation of social skills in the
the US O*NET system and UK
SOC occupational codes, and then
matched UK occupational data with information on task content.6 In line with the literature on skill- and task-
workplace has changed over time, given
the US-based evidence that social
skills are of growing importance in the labour market. 9 We measure social skills as the average of the importance

characterised occupations according
to their intensities in three sorts of tasks: routine, manual and abstract. 7 The delineation along these lines is motivated by the fact that technology,

ranks of occupations for each of the

these ranks in subsequent years. By
Figure 2 shows how changes in the occupational distribution from 1994 to 2018 have
altered the skills used in tasks performed by the UK labour force. As explained in Box
1, each occupation has been associated with its intensity in the four different tasks or
skills, and the chart plots how the usage of the skills have changed over time as different
occupations have become more or less common. It shows that the occupational shifts
that have taken place since 1994 imply a substantial growth in the use of both social
skills and abstract skills, and a marked decline in the use of manual and routine skills
in the labour force. For example, the average intensity of the abstract skill task across
all jobs undertaken in 2018 lay about 8 centiles higher than its 1994 level (see Box 1 for
an explanation of this). The growth in the importance of social skills is similar, and the
importance of routine and manual skills has declined.

Figure 3 paints a similar picture but instead looks at how employment shares have
changed between 1994 and 2019. This time we compute changes in employment shares
at each centile of each task measure: occupations are assigned a rank according to
their percentile position in the (employment-weighted) skill distribution in 1994 for
each task, and the chart shows the change in importance of different occupations
depending on how intensively they use different skills. It highlights an almost-monotonic
relationship between the intensity at which each task type is used in each occupation
and the change in its employment share: occupations requiring high levels of abstract
and social tasks have increased their employment shares, but occupations that involve
intensive use of routine and manual tasks have seen declining employment shares. To
give examples: occupations that had large increases in employment share and involve
intensive use of abstract tasks include public health managers and directors, IT specialist
managers, and IT business analysts. On the other hand, there have been large declines
in the employment shares of jobs like metal workers, assemblers, and plastic process
operatives, all of which rank highly on routine task intensity. Jobs that require high levels of social skills – such as directorial positions in marketing and sales, human resources,
and customer services – have increased their employment shares as well.

The return to abstract skills has increased markedly
Figures 2 and 3 document an increased role in the labour market for social and abstract
skills, but it is also interesting to look at changes in the wage that can be earned in jobs
that are particularly intensive in certain skills.
It is not always simple to interpret changes in the wages associated with different skills,
because wages are affected by both the supply of and demand for skills. If, though, the
supply of some skills increases without a commensurate wage decline (or even with
a wage increase), then this is often interpreted as evidence that the increase in the demand for those skills is greater than the increase in supply.10 This is the interpretation given to the fact that the return to university education rose between 1980 and 2000 despite the supply of university-educated workers increasing, for example.11
A further issue is that the supply of workers who can perform different skills is not
directly observable. But we can use employment shares in different occupations – as shown in Figure 3 – as a proxy. If we do this, considering both Figure 3 and Figure 4
together suggests that the supply of workers endowed with abstract skills has failed to
keep pace with the demand for these skills. This is because wage growth has been high in
occupations making use of abstract skills (shown in Figure 4), at the same time as there
has been strong employment growth in abstract-task-intensive occupations (shown in
Figure 3). Together, these facts suggest that the demand for abstract skills has exceeded
the supply of workers with these skills.
Figure 4 also shows that there is strong wage growth at the higher centiles across all
four tasks; that is, occupations where tasks are used very intensively (regardless of
what skill that is) are those that have exhibited strong wage growth. However, drawing
firm conclusions from Figure 4 is difficult partly because the relationship between
the skill measures is harder to interpret, and partly because it would require a deeper understanding of how the various task types interact with each other in the workplace.12 To see this, consider a world where highly skill-intensive occupations are those that
rely on one task requirement at the expense of others (i.e. if occupations high in routine
task requirement require little to no social, abstract, and manual skills); if so, then Figure
3 would suggest that wage gains have occurred for those in the most specialised (as
measured by task content) occupations. But the pattern in Figure 3 is also consistent
with a world where highly skill-intensive occupations also require other skills, which
would suggest that diverse, not specialised skills, lead to the biggest wage gains.

While social skills grew in importance between 1980 and 2012 in the US, returns were particularly high for those whose job required a mix of both social and abstract skills. See: D Deming, The Growing Importance of Social Skills in the Labor Market, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, June 2017.

The increased use of abstract and social skills has benefitted higher-paid and better-educated workers
Figures 2 to 4 show what tasks are associated with those occupations that have seen
changes in employment shares or wages over time; however, this does not tell us which
workers (along the initial wage distribution) have experienced these changes. Figure 5
looks at the relationship between the task content of jobs and wage centiles in 1994. It
shows that workers at the top end of the wage distribution are more likely to use both
social skills and abstract tasks in the workplace, and the converse is true of those in the
bottom half of the wage distribution. Lower-paid workers perform manual and routine
tasks on a more regular basis.
If we combine the insights from Figure 5 with the employment and wage changes
depicted in Figures 3 and 4, then we can conclude that workers at the bottom and
middle of the wage distribution have seen significantly less (and sometimes negative)
employment growth and lower wage returns to their skills between 1994 and 2019,
compared to those workers performing jobs at the top of the wage distribution.

Figure 6 looks at how task content differs by education level.13 Unsurprisingly, given the results in Figure 5 and the strong relationship between education levels and wages, those
with higher levels of education are much more likely to use social and abstract tasks in
the workplace. Those with basic qualifications, or no qualifications, are more likely to use
routine and manual tasks once in the workplace. As with wages, there is a middle ground
with intermediate levels of education (those leaving education with ‘good’ GCSEs or an
intermediate vocational qualification) using a broader mix of skills when at work. This
tells us that the shift in what skills are being used in the UK labour market since the mid-
1990s is one that has favoured better-educated workers.

The volume of workplace training has been falling, contributing to the slowdown in human capital growth
The analysis above shows that task requirements have changed significantly over recent
decades in the UK labour market, most likely in a way that advantaged those who were
already better-educated and undertaking better-paid jobs. The rest of this note turns to
the provision of on-the-job training, as this is an important way by which workers acquire skills and qualifications during their working lives after formal education.14
The long-term trend is that the volume of training provided to workers has been slowing down over the past 20 years.15 One measure of this is the proportion of workers who report receiving work-related training in the past three months (this is set out in Figure
7). The high point was in 2002, when 29 per cent of workers said they had received work-
related training. Since then the rate of training has fallen, reaching a low point of 24
per cent in 2020, a 16 per cent fall. Other measures of the volume of workplace training

present a similar picture. The number of days training received per employee or per
trainee is lower than a decade ago; as are the proportion of employers who report they are providing training and the amount of money spent on training by employers.16

Some have criticised the Apprenticeship Levy as contributing to falling numbers of
apprenticeship starts and employer-led training in general, but the fall in workplace training far predates the Levy’s introduction in 2017.17
Perhaps more concerning than the overall fall in training is the fact that the slowdown in
training has been most pronounced among younger workers. Between 2002 and 2020,
those aged 16-24 saw their training rate fall by over a quarter (by 27 per cent, falling from
39 per cent to 29 per cent), as shown in Figure 8. Meanwhile, the proportion of workers
receiving training has fallen less steeply among those aged 25-49 and has not fallen at all
among those aged 50 and above, and the proportion receiving training has actually risen
among workers aged 65 and above. These trends mean that today’s generation of young workers receive significantly less training from their employers than previous cohorts.18

The fall in training incidence among young workers has happened across occupations: it
is not the result of young workers becoming more represented in low-training jobs. Figure
9 shows how training rates among 18-34-year-olds changed between 1996 and 2019,
with a breakdown by occupation. The vertical axis shows the change in the incidence of
training, the horizontal axis plots the incidence of training in 2019, and the bubble size
shows the industry’s share of 18-34 employment in 2019. Clearly, many occupations fall
below zero on the vertical axis, indicating that training rates fell in these occupations. In
addition, several higher-paid occupations saw steep falls in training incidence. On the
other hand, it is in the higher-paid occupations – such as professionals in business and
science or research – where young people are more likely to receive training.

Workplace training exacerbates existing inequality in human capital
The second key problem with workplace training is that it exacerbates, rather than
mitigates, inequalities in human capital. This is because workers with higher levels of
existing qualifications are significantly more likely than lower-qualified workers to receive
training.
This is shown in Figure 10, which plots the incidence of workplace training by education
level, rather than earnings. Irrespective of whether we look at training in the previous
month or previous quarter, better-qualified workers receive more training. Those with a
‘higher’ education qualification (NVQ 4 and above) are twice as likely to have received
training in the previous quarter than those with below secondary level education.
Training itself is particularly high for the most-educated workers, with an average of close to 40 per cent reporting having received some form of training in the previous quarter. 19
19 It’s worth noting that this relationship between qualification level and training incidence holds even when we control for other
factors, including age and industry (two factors across which training incidence varies considerably). Between 2016 and 2021, the incidence of workplace training among workers with degree level qualifications was 50 per cent higher than workers with GCSE-level qualifications (31 per cent versus 19 per cent). Holding age and industry constant, this difference is only marginally smaller (the incidence falls from 11 percentage points to a still-large 9 percentage points).

These low rates of training among the least educated are troubling, given international evidence showing that there are higher returns to adult education for these individuals.20

NOTES: LFS education variables are assigned into five NVQ levels using the implied ordering of qualifications in the LFS. A similar approach is taken in H Steedman, S McIntosh & A Green, International Comparisons of Qualifications: Skills Audit Update, DfE Research Report No. 548, 2004. Those with no qualifications or NVQ1 are deemed as below secondary, NVQ2 is lower secondary, NVQ3 is upper secondary, while NVQ4 and above is higher. SOURCE: Analysis of Labour Force Survey.
Education is one dimension by which training opportunities can differ, but it is not the
only one. Access can differ by employment type as well. This dimension is likely to grow
in importance as more workers opt – out of choice and necessity – into self-employed work.21 Figure 11 highlights that employees aged 25-59 are significantly more likely to take part in most forms of education and training than the self-employed or those not working.22 The sole exception to this is full-time education, where the workless are the most-frequent recipients (although there are very few people in this category). There are
sizeable gaps in training rates between employees and the self-employed, the former
being 61 per cent more likely to get training. There are also differences in the type of
training received by different kinds of worker, with employees more likely to take longer

forms of training than the self-employed, and ones more likely to lead to a qualification:
nearly one-in-five (18 per cent) employees reported having a qualification-bearing training
in the previous year, but about half as many (just over one-in-ten, or 11 per cent) self-
employed workers did.
There are well-known reasons why firms may be reticent to provide training to their
workers: training is costly to provide and, at least for general training, the gains from
having a highly-trained worker are lost should the worker leave or be poached by another firm.23 However, the evidence above suggests that self-employed workers, who tend to forgo earnings to access training, face more barriers to access than their employed
counterparts.

Training is of particular importance for those out-of-work, but rates of training are very
low for this group. Among adults who are out of work (both inactive and unemployed,
23 It is worth noting that in Becker’s competitive model (G Becker, Investment in Human Capital: Effects on Earnings, January 1975), workers still receive the optimal amount of general training as they bear the cost of it themselves. This result relies on the absence of imperfections in the credit market. For a theoretical overview of training provision in non-competitive markets, see: D Acemoglu & J S Pischke, Beyond Becker: Training in Imperfect Labour Markets, The Economic Journal 109(453), February 1999.

but excluding students and those who say that they are retired), training rates are very
low: only 12 per cent receive any training, less than half the rate at which employees are
trained. Fewer than one-in-ten out-of-work adults received longer or qualification-bearing
forms of training.
Figure 12 builds upon the previous analysis by looking at differences in training provision
by broad occupational categories. Much of our focus has been on skills and how training
can aid skill development. While we remain agnostic as to the relative usefulness
of different types of training, it is interesting to see how training type differs at the
occupation level and whether specific skill-focused training is more prevalent in certain
occupations than others.

Figure 12 highlights that workers in different occupations report relatively different forms
of training. Of the workers in mid- and lower-paid occupations receiving training, more
reported that their training was for health and safety purposes, rather than (for example)
to improve their skills (and productivity), progress in their role, or move to another role.
For example, more than one-third (37 per cent) of process operatives who had training
reported that it was for health and safety, more than twice the share of professionals who
[Page #19]
The Economy 2030 Inquiry | Train in Vain?
did (17 per cent). By contrast, nearly a third of professionals reported that their training
was intended to improve their current job skills (19 per cent) or get promoted in their
current job (13 per cent); among operatives, 15 per cent reported their training was to
improve their current job skills, and just 4 per cent reported it was intended to help them
attain a promotion. In other words, it appears that many UK workers who receive training
tend to see that training as maintaining occupational or health and safety standards,
rather than improving their general, or job-related skills. These patterns are particularly
strong for workers in roles that tend to require lower-level qualifications, meaning that
those workers who could benefit from education and training to improve in their current
job and boost productivity, or move to a new type of role, are unlikely to receive it.
Most forms of training do not drastically increase the odds of a worker changing industry, especially for workers with lower-level qualifications
Not all work-based training is intended to improve worker’s skills and employability, but it
is still interesting to examine the relationship between receipt of training and outcomes
in the labour market. Recent research highlights a certain paralysis in the UK labour
market whereby workers in declining sectors struggle to move into expanding sectors of the economy.24 What role might training play in reskilling workers and enabling them to progress in their careers?
Figure 13 looks at the extent of inter-industry moves and how these correlate with
recent receipt of training. It shows that most forms of training have a small association
with making a significant job move, captured here in terms of moving industry (at the
single-digit SIC code level). In particular, among workers who received no training in the
previous 12 months, roughly 12 per cent move industry each year, but 15 per cent of those
who had longer forms of training (excluding training that was reported as a hobby or for
health and safety purposes) switch industry over a given 12-month period. This rate is
largely unchanged (14 per cent) if we focus on training leading to a qualification.
The form of training that is most strongly associated with making a significant job move
is full-time education. Full-time education increases these odds (to 23 per cent), but very
few adults partake in full-time education to begin with: just under 1 per cent of employees
and the self-employed do so, no doubt reflecting the challenges in terms of forgone earnings – and indeed tuition costs – of returning to full-time study as an adult.25

Education and training can increase the odds of a person returning to work within two years of becoming workless, although the effects are patchiest for adults with lower-level qualifications
Another important role of training is to provide a pathway back into employment. For
example, 13 per cent of those not in work take part in training in any given year, but what
does this mean for their employment prospects?
Figure 14 looks at how the odds of returning to work vary according to whether an
individual had received training in the previous year. Training is positively associated
with returning to employment within two years of becoming workless: of those who
do no training, 54 per cent return within that timeframe, and this proportion rises to
between 69 and 71 per cent (depending upon the form of training ) for those who have had training.26 This suggests that training may be effective for helping workless people

improve their job prospects, but it should be remembered that relatively few workless
individuals receive training. Understanding why this is would require a more in-depth
analysis, focusing not only the prospect of finding work but also the costs of training and
what kind of jobs training leads to (for example, whether individuals move into a better-
paid, higher-quality job than their previous one).

NOTES: Training undertaken one year prior. Regression analysis tests for the likelihood of returning to work, and being in work for one of the following three waves conditioned on the type of training undertaken. Controls are: sex, age, age squared, number of children, highest qualification (current), highest qualification (three waves ago), region interacted with whether area is classed as urban or rural, two-digit occupation three waves ago (including if missing), one-digit industry three waves ago (including if missing), weekly job hours three waves ago. Respondents classed as frequent trainers (those who reported any form of training or full-time education in the current wave, three previous waves and also future waves) are removed, as are those who said their training purpose was ‘hobbies’ or ‘health and safety.’SOURCE: Analysis of ISER, Understanding Society.
Figure 14 looks at all workers out of work, but training is arguably most needed for those
with lower-level qualifications. Here it appears that only qualification-bearing training is
associated with an improvement in the odds of their returning to work: a previous version
of this analysis showed that 53 per cent of non-graduates who didn’t have training moved
into work after a spell of worklessness, compared to 71 per cent of those that undertook qualification-bearing training.27

Conclusion
This note has shown that changes in the UK labour market have boosted the demand
for social skills and abstract task utilisation, and this demand has been (partially) met by
highly-paid, highly-educated workers. At the same time, those leaving education with low-
level academic and vocational educations appear left behind as technological change
continues apace. This suggests that that there is a growing need for training to help
upskill the workers most at risk in the changing labour market. Unfortunately, training
provision in the UK is not currently playing the role that it could do. Rates of training
are falling and, even though the gap is narrowing, those who need training the most are
the least likely to receive it. What’s more, most of the training is not explicitly focused on
skills and has only a marginal association with the probability of changing one’s skill set
and moving industry. In addition, it can be argued that UK firms lack the (tax) incentives
to invest in human capital – the generosity of tax credits and (super)deductions tend to
strongly favour capital and R&D, leaving investments in human capital, including training, fighting an uphill battle when it comes to firms deciding how to re-invest profits.28
Despite this, it would be wrong to think that the current state of affairs is fixed. There
is a wealth of international evidence that could be drawn upon to design a system that
makes post-school training provision work for more of the UK’s labour force. Recent
evidence from over 1,000 policy evaluations highlights how employment training can work when the programs are skill intensive and involve a strong on-the-job component.29 Interestingly, in light of our findings that soft skills are of growing importance in the
UK economy, recent work has highlighted how training in soft skills can be particularly
effective for workers in low-skilled occupations, and that there can be high returns to vocational training in interpersonal skills.30 In a world of stagnant productivity growth and with an increasing need for workers’ wages to keep pace with prices, the UK’s
current system of training and skills provision would appear to be an area where policy
could have an enormously beneficial impact. Phase 2 of the Inquiry will further analyse
the deficiencies present in the current provision of human capital and advance policy
recommendations in this field that can ultimately contribute to higher and more
inclusive economic growth for the UK.
