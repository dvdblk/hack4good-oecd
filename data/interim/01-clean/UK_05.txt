Executive Summary
Britain is on the verge of an employment crisis, with labour-intensive and lower-paid sectors hardest hit
The coronavirus crisis has already brought significant disruption
to the UK labour market, leading to sharp falls in the number
of people employed, the number of hours they work and the
number of job vacancies on offer. Before the crisis set in, nearly
one-in-five UK workers (19 per cent) were in a sector that would
be (temporarily) shut down, a large proportion of whom were
low-paid and had lower-level qualifications.
Although many workers were furloughed under the Coronavirus
Job Retention Scheme (JRS) and have now started to come
back to work, there are growing concerns that employment
in labour-intensive sectors offering in-person services will
continue to suffer. For instance, nearly four-in-ten workers in
hospitality and leisure, and one-in-ten workers in non-essential retail, remain furloughed. With the JRS starting to wind down
from this month and these sectors still facing significant supply
constraints, many more adults could soon be out of work.
They will need support to re-enter employment swiftly if we
are to avoid lasting high unemployment. Moreover, some of
the sectoral shifts currently happening are likely to be more
permanent in nature. It remains to be seen the extent to which
the hospitality and leisure sectors will recover from this crisis in
the medium term, but the retail sector is very likely to continue
to decline, as it had been doing before this crisis hit.
[Page #4]
Can training help workers change their stripes? | Executive Summary
The prospect of a rise in unemployment means that the
Government will need to consider adult education and
retraining policies that will help some workless adults move
back into work and help other adults move to different sectors.
Recent retraining debates have been narrowly focused on the automation threat, with broader formal training outside the workplace in decline
Unfortunately, the UK is not in a particularly strong position
to do this. Before the current crisis, retraining policy was
frequently discussed within the context of the job-displacing
effects that automation and technological change could have
upon declining heavy industries. This led to calls for retraining
schemes that were centred on sectors like manufacturing. These calls failed to recognise the fact that most of the decline
in manufacturing has been driven by a longer-term fall in
the number of workers moving into the sector, rather than a
rise in the numbers leaving manufacturing and moving into
unemployment. In fact, over recent years the annual number of
workers leaving service sectors like hospitality and retail (which
have taken a bigger hit in the current crisis) and moving into
unemployment (152,000 and 108,000, respectively) has been larger
than the number leaving manufacturing (105,000).
More broadly, training not directly linked to one’s current job
has declined by 20 per cent since the early 2000s. And across
both this type of training and employer-led training, which is
much more common in Britain (roughly 6 million UK adults
report having work-related training in a given year, compared
to only about 1.6 million in formal education outside of work),
participation is biased towards the already highly qualified. In
other words, the existing system offers fewer opportunities
both for those not currently connected to employers, and for the
lower-qualified workers most at risk of losing their jobs in the
current crisis.
[Page #5]
Can training help workers change their stripes? | Executive Summary
Policy makers looking to tackle high unemployment via retraining therefore find themselves in a difficult position
Policy makers looking to fend off unemployment in the current
crisis are therefore in a difficult position: current training
provision and debates tend to overlook the types of workers who
are most at risk of losing their jobs, and most in need of moving
sectors. This challenge should cast a sharp light on the role of
adult education and training: to what extent can it help workers
re-enter the labour market, and to what extent can it help them
retrain for work in entirely different sectors?
To help answer these questions, this report uses data from
Understanding Society over the 2012-18 period in order to
understand the relationship between broad types of education
and training and the likelihood of a person either re-entering the
labour market after a spell of worklessness, or changing industry
(and in doing so, attaining a pay rise). As well as comparing the
relative effects of training upon the odds of achieving these
outcomes, having controlled for a variety of personal and work-
related factors, we explore the extent to which the effects vary
across different groups of adults.
Our aim is not to discuss variation in the economic returns that
exist between different types of qualifications (which is already
covered by a rich body of research), but instead to shed light on
the broader link between education and training and making
important career transitions.
There is a strong association between training and returning to work, particularly among non-graduates
One-in-twenty (5 per cent) of 25-59-year-olds in the UK
experienced a spell of worklessness during 2012-18. A range
of different types of training were statistically significantly
associated with them moving back into work, holding constant
various personal and work-related characteristics. For instance,
absent any education or training, we would expect 53 per cent of 25-59-year-olds who had recently moved out of work to return to
a job within two years. We would expect 71 per cent of 25-59-year-
[Page #6]
Can training help workers change their stripes? | Executive Summary
olds who had training that resulted in a qualification to do so (a
difference of 19 percentage points).
While training linked to a qualification had a somewhat stronger
association with returning to work, we didn’t identify big
differences between different lengths of training, with longer
forms of training not having much of a stronger relationship
with returning to work as compared to shorter courses. There
were clearer differences between different subgroups of adults,
however, with the association between training and returning
to work greatest for non-graduates, and younger non-graduate
women in particular. Absent any training, 39 per cent of those
in this group who had recently moved out of work returned, a
figure boosted to 62 per cent among those who had undertaken
training resulting in a qualification (a 23 percentage point difference). Older non-graduate men also received a particularly
large boost to the odds of returning to work from training.
There is less evidence to suggest a strong association between most forms of training and career change; only full-time education bears a significant link
Beyond simply returning to work, there is the question of how –
and to what extent – education and retraining can help workers
change sector, and ideally change sector while obtaining higher
levels of pay than they received before. Therefore, our research
tests the association between training and the odds of a person
moving industry, again controlling for several personal and
work-related characteristics.
We find somewhat small, though statistically significant,
associations between some forms of training and changing
industry. For instance, absent any education or training, we
would expect 15 per cent of 25-59-year-olds to currently be
working in a sector that is different from the one they worked
in three years ago. We would expect 18 per cent of those who
had taken training that resulted in a qualification to have done
so. The association between industry change and full-time
education is, however, much larger: we would expect 31 per cent
of those who had undertaken full-time education in the interim
[Page #7]
Can training help workers change their stripes? | Executive Summary
to be working in a different sector to the one in which they were
employed in prior to full-time study.
The relationship between training and making a ‘positive’
industry change (i.e. both working in a different industry
and experiencing a 10 per cent pay boost) is similar. Full-time
education is again the only form of training associated with
a substantial increase in the likelihood of a positive industry
change: while we would expect just 5 per cent of workers who
have not experienced training to have both changed industry
and received a minimum 10 per pay rise compared to three years
ago, we would expect 11 per cent of those who had completed
some full-time education in the interim to have done so. Once
again, these effects are largest for non-graduates, particularly
older non-graduate men and women.
It is important to put these findings into context. Only a small
proportion of people take on the more intensive forms of full-
time training that we find associated with big career changes,
with just one per cent of 25-59-year-olds in full-time study. This
may reflect barriers that prevent adults from taking up such
intensive study: for instance, the availability of appropriate
courses, their own or the state’s capacity to pay for it, and the
perceived cost-benefit to doing so. Whatever the drivers, it’s clear
that Britain has little recent experience of success in this area.
Policy makers should avoid retraining policies that are centred on specific challenges or narrow groups of workers, and instead focus their current efforts on tackling unemployment
Given the scale of the current crisis, and the types of workers
most affected, it is long past time for the UK’s retraining
narrative to move beyond specific forms of job loss and narrow
groups of workers (e.g. automation and industrial decline). Policy
makers should look to education and training as one way to
tackle the high levels of unemployment that we are likely to be
facing. They should recognise the positive role that training can
play in helping lower-qualified workers re-enter a job after a
spell of worklessness, particularly when linked to qualifications,
[Page #8]
Can training help workers change their stripes? | Executive Summary
and particularly for non-graduates (and younger women and
older men within them). Of course, even with training, helping
recently-redundant workers to re-enter the labour market
could prove far more difficult to achieve if vacancies in labour-
intensive sectors with low barriers to entry (e.g. hospitality,
entertainment and retail) remain thinner on the ground than
they were during the majority of the period we studied (2012-18).
Where the goal is to shift large numbers of workers from one
sector to another, our findings are more challenging. There is
little evidence to show that shorter courses make much of a
difference in helping workers change sector on their own. And
while full-time education does appear more strongly linked
to the odds of changing sector, it’s unlikely that a majority of
unemployed adults, or those in work but looking to change sector, would be either willing or able to afford to return to full-
time study in the years to come.
Similarly, looking abroad for answers on how to develop national,
large-scale retraining schemes that match displaced workers
to jobs in growing sectors is not entirely straightforward.
Some of the more successful retraining regimes that persist
in Scandinavian countries rely on a long history of close
engagement between employers, unions and government. This
is a tripartite structure that has historically been more fragile
in the UK, and largely lacking in the specific sectors worst hit
by the current crisis. In other words, retraining systems cannot
easily be imported.
In the short-to-medium term, government should consider
policies that would help adults re-enter work and/or change
career by adopting more sector-focused job creation initiatives
that have training built into them. For instance, we have
previously called for investment in social care and ‘green jobs’
like home retrofitting as a way to boost sectoral reallocation and
tackle unemployment during this crisis. By providing training
very directly linked to government-led job creation in areas
with relatively low skills barriers to entry, courses can be more
specific and shorter than the full-time study that has historically
been shown to make a difference in supporting sectoral change.
[Page #9]
Can training help workers change their stripes? | Executive Summary
In fact, government playing a role in job creation could help
overcome the lack of tripartite coordination that prevails in the
UK.
The unemployment effects of the coronavirus crisis are only
beginning to emerge. Tackling these effects will require a multi-
pronged approach that should include the swift provision of
training that has proven effective in helping adults re-enter
work from worklessness, and strategies that link retraining to
achievable (and desirable) job creation initiatives in other sectors.
These are difficult challenges to which no single policy will serve
as a panacea, but that doesn’t mean policy makers should shy
away from them.

Section 1
Training and adult education before the coronavirus crisis
Before the onset of the coronavirus crisis, the common narrative around adult
education and training tended to focus on the threat of automation and technological
change, and the needs of those in manufacturing who are thought to be most at risk
of displacement. Unfortunately, this framing tended to overlook the majority of lower-
qualified workers, many of whom work in sectors that have felt the most acute effects
of the current crisis.
This section discusses why calls to retrain a specific subset of displaced workers are
wide of the mark. We show that much of the decline in sectors like manufacturing has
been driven less by a rise in people moving out of the sector, and more by a long-term
reduction in people moving into it. We also place this recent retraining preoccupation
in the broader context of Britain’s pre-coronavirus adult retraining system, showing
that training not directly linked to one’s current employer had been in long-term
decline; and both this and the much larger volumes of employer-led training have
been tilted towards those who already have higher-level qualifications.
In recent years, calls for retraining have been predicated upon automation and industrial decline
Much of the recent discussion around adult education has been driven by fears that
technological change and automation could drive large-scale redundancies. Predictions
about the size and shape of the effects that automation could have on employment tend
to vary: the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated that 7 per cent (1.5 million) of all UK jobs were at high risk of automation in 2017;1 the professional services firm, PwC, estimated that 30 per cent of UK jobs would be at high risk of automation by the 2030s;2 and analysis from the consultancy Oxford Economics predicted that by 2030 as many

as 20 million manufacturing jobs could be lost worldwide, including “several hundred thousand” UK jobs.3 4
Despite coming to different conclusions on how many jobs could be at risk, the
combined effect of these reports was to drive up calls for large-scale retraining
programmes. For instance, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) found that one million UK jobs could be at risk of automation, in particular many
in manufacturing. They called on the UK to develop a large-scale retraining programme
in response to automation, where £90 billion would be spent on both retraining and replacing workers’ lost wages as they return to study.5
Retraining workers who leave declining sectors like manufacturing is a worthwhile policy, but its limited focus skips over the larger number of adults losing jobs in coronavirus-hit sectors
The manufacturing sector has been declining for several decades, and automation studies have singled out manufacturing roles as particularly likely to become obsolete over the medium term.6 It is therefore unsurprising that manufacturing workers have played a large role in the country’s retraining narrative.
It is right that we try to prevent workers from being pushed out of work and into
unemployment (or inactivity). However, the specific focus on automation (and, within
that, manufacturing) that garnered a large amount of space in the UK’s adult education
policy narrative was too narrow. This has become even more true during the pandemic,
given that many of the workers that this approach risked glossing over were from in-
person service sectors hard-hit by the current crisis.
As a proportion of total UK employment, manufacturing (a proxy for sectors widely
affected by technological change) has indeed declined markedly: it comprised nearly 20
per cent of jobs in 1995, compared to just under 10 per cent today. The relative decline in
retail has been much smaller (from roughly 10 per cent to 7 per cent).
And yet, figures from the ONS’s longitudinal Labour Force Survey indicate that the decline in manufacturing has been driven less by a rise in the number workers moving out of the sector and more by a longer-term reduction in the number of workers moving into it. Figure 1 shows that manufacturing’s outflow rate (the number of people leaving the sector over a quarter as a proportion of all those working in the sector in the previous

5 T Wallace, UK faces £90bn bill to retrain one million workers who face losing jobs to robots, The Telegraph, May 2019.6 Studies on automation and the future of the workforce tend to draw a distinction between roles that could be partially affected by automation (for instance, certain tasks within a particular job may change) and those that would become obsolete as a result of a firm taking on new technology.

quarter) has held roughly flat, at around 5 per cent, since the series began. And that
outflow rate has been either middle- or low-ranking compared to the seven other sectors
featured here – especially those sectors, like retail and hospitality, which have been badly
hit by the current crisis.

But while the manufacturing sector’s outflow rate has appeared roughly mid-pack and
stable since the mid-1990s, its inflow rate (the number of people entering a sector over a
quarter as a proportion of everyone not employed in that sector in the previous quarter)
appears to have played a much larger role in its decline. Figure 2 shows that the inflow
rate declined from the beginning of our time series in 1995 to the mid-2000s, thereafter
holding relatively flat.
The fall in the manufacturing sector’s inflow rate is larger than that of any other sector
over the 24 years from 1995 to 2019, and stands in direct contrast to the growing inflow
rates for public administration, finance, insurance and business services over the same
time period. In other words, it appears that manufacturing’s decline has been driven by
a relatively large and steady fall in inflows (the bulk of which occurred well over a decade
ago), rather than by a recent or abnormally large increase in outflows.

Of course, many of these flows will reflect workers ‘churning’ from one sector to another.
However, the potential for workers to move out a declining sector and into worklessness
has characterised much of the discussion around automation and the need for retraining
policies. But although manufacturing leavers used to move into unemployment at a
higher rate than leavers from all sectors, on average, there is little significant difference
today. In fact, even before the onset of the current crisis, it was retail leavers who stood out as more likely than average to move into unemployment.7
Putting to one side the rates of movement to unemployment and inactivity, policy makers should naturally be concerned about the overall number of workers moving out of work, given that this would – in most circumstances – form a pool of adults in
need of job search assistance and/or retraining. Again, however, the evidence does not
suggest that manufacturing is a uniquely worrying case. Table 1 shows the total number
of workers that moved out of a particular sector on average each year during 2015-18,
and within that, the number who moved into other employment, into unemployment
and into inactivity. When viewed in absolute terms, the number of workers flowing out of manufacturing and into unemployment was roughly ‘mid-pack’ (i.e. 105,000 per year from

manufacturing, relative to 238,000 from public administration and 108,000 from hotels
and restaurants). In percentage terms, 27 per cent of all workers moving from a job into
unemployment came from public administration, education and health, 16 per cent from
finance, 14 per cent from retail, 11 per cent from hotels and restaurants and just 8 per
cent came from manufacturing.

Our argument is not that the 8 per cent of manufacturing workers moving into
unemployment should be overlooked, but instead that adult education policies focused
primarily on retraining at-risk workers from more easily-automatable sectors like
manufacturing can easily skip over the even larger number of workers moving out of
other sectors that could also potentially benefit from quality education and training –
particularly those sectors that are struggling even more now as a result of the pandemic.
More broadly, non-employer-led training has been in decline, and the large majority of adult education and training that actually exists is focused on workers with higher-level qualifications
Putting to one side in-vogue retraining debates, it’s worth reflecting on the adult training
that we actually deliver in the UK. The large majority is employer-led: according to
figures for the Labour Force Survey (LFS) for 2019, roughly 6.2 million in-work 25-59-year-
olds (24 per cent) recently had some form of work-related training. By contrast, we estimate that just 1.6 million 25-59-year-olds (5 per cent) were enrolled in any full- or
[Page #15]
Can training help workers change their stripes? | Retraining and career change in the UK
part-time education course (excluding those done for leisure purposes).8 The fact that the UK has focused on employer-led adult skills development – not least via reforms to
apprenticeships – is not necessarily a bad thing, attempting to align the delivery of skills
training with current demand. But it is concerning that non-employer-led training has
declined by 20 per cent since the early 2000s, especially now that the current crisis is disrupting many firms and sectors.9

8 These figures correspond to data from the Department for Education as well from the Higher Education Statistics Agency: roughly 1.1 million adults in England participated in an adult further education classroom-based course in 2018/19 (a reduction of 30 per cent since 2011/12) and 730,000 adults age 25 and over were enrolled in a part- or-full time course at a higher education institution in the same year. However, the higher education figure does include foreign students and there is the potential for some overlap across the two data sources, such as where a student is registered on a higher education course but studying that course at a further education college. See: Department for Education, Further Education and Skills, March 2020; Higher Education Statistics Agency, Higher Education Student Statistics: UK, 2018/19 - Student numbers and characteristics, January 2020.
9 Participation in adult further education has fallen for a number of reasons, including funding reductions and learner eligibility restrictions: although all adults without a Level 2-equiavlent English and Maths qualification are entitled to study one free of charge, funding for other lower- and mid-level qualifications has been siphoned off over recent years. For example, all adults without a ‘full’ Level 2 qualification (as opposed to a course that sits within a larger qualification) were in the past eligible to study for one free of charge. But since 2016/17, those age 24 and over and in work have been required to pay half tuition costs. Additionally, all adults without a full Level 3 qualification were in the past able to study for a Level 3 course for free but since 2016/17, only 19-23-year-olds have been able to continue to do so (provided it is their first), while everyone age 24 and older has either had to pay upfront or take out at an Advanced Learner Loan. See: Department for Education, Independent panel report to the Review of Post-18 Education and Funding, May 2019.
[Page #16]
Can training help workers change their stripes? | Retraining and career change in the UK
Moreover, adults who undergo of training are substantially more likely to already have
a high-level qualification. LFS figures show that adults with a Master’s degree or higher
are nearly twice as likely to report recently having had work-related training than their
counterparts qualified only to GCSE-equivalent levels of education (see Figure 9 and
Figure 10 in the annex). And figures from Understanding Society (Figure 3) illustrate stark
qualification-based differences in training purposes between adults.
Among those non-graduates that report having had any training in the past year, health
and safety remains the most common purpose. By contrast, training appears to offer
graduates the opportunity to improve their skills and maintain occupational standards. In
other words, the existing training opportunities for many lower-qualified adults do little to
help them develop the skills for progressing in work or changing career.
Lower-qualified adults, a large proportion of whom are young, are most likely to have been affected by the current economic crisis
So far, the substantial reductions in employment and sharp sectoral downturns that have
characterised the current economic crisis have disproportionately affected younger and
lower-paid workers. While to some extent this is down to employment patterns (younger
and lower-paid workers are more likely to work in highly affected sectors like hospitality
and retail), recent Resolution Foundation research has found that low-paid workers are
still more likely to be furloughed than their higher-paid counterparts, even after sector and a range of other characteristics are taken into account.10
The large employment effects of this crisis have therefore cast a brighter light onto
the UK’s adult education and training system for two related reasons. First, because as
in most recessions, there will be a large number of adults who have recently lost work
(many of whom will have lower levels of education) who will need help getting back
to work in a more competitive labour market. Second, because of the unique sectoral
effects of this particular crisis: if many of the crisis’s worst hit sectors (hospitality, retail
and transport) decline either temporarily or in the longer term (with retail particularly likely to decline over the longer term given pre-coronavirus trends11), a large proportion of recently redundant workers will need to change sectors in order to find work.
These outcomes have led to calls for employment support and training programmes to support workers and jobs during this crisis.12 Many of these calls rightly recognise that, while some out-of-work adults may be able to shift back into work through a combination

of advice and shorter-length training, others would be better served by participating
in a longer, more intensive retraining process to allow them to take up a new career in
a growing sector. In other words, the current crisis underscores the need for an adult education and training system that can help all workers re-enter the labour market, as well as helping some be reallocated to growing sectors.
This is a tall order, particularly for an education and training system that has, over recent
decades, left the largely lower-qualified workers most affected in the current crisis
without much cover.
By looking to the (recent) past, we can better understand the extent to which (re)training can meet the employment challenges in the current crisis
Both the scale of the current crisis and the limited focus of adult retraining debates
complicate efforts to learn from recent policy initiatives. However, it is important that we
understand the adult education system we have, the outcomes it delivers and for whom it is most successful if we are to implement effective policy to deal with both longer-
standing (e.g. relating to automation) and more recently emerging (e.g. relating to the
coronavirus crisis) challenges.
On that basis, this report uses data from Understanding Society collected over 2012-18 in
order to estimate the effects of broad types of education and training upon the odds of
a person either re-entering the labour market after a spell of worklessness, or changing
industry (and in doing so, attaining a pay rise). As well as comparing the relative effects
of training on the odds of achieving these outcomes having controlled for a variety of personal and work-related factors, we also explore the extent to which different forms of training are associated with either re-entry or reallocation for different groups of adults.
The aim is not to generate information on the individual economic returns that exist between different types of qualifications,13 but instead to gauge the association between participating in adult education and making important career transitions.
The remainder of this report is set out as follows:
 • The next section of this report, Section 2, presents patterns of labour market
re-entry for individuals experiencing a spell of worklessness, before going on to
analyse the extent to which different types and intensities of training are associated
13 There is a rich body of academic research outlining the financial returns to different types and levels of qualifications, with
results often differing between methods and comparison groups. Differences include, for instance, whether the comparator is an individual who does not have a particular qualification, began studying for said qualification but did not complete it, or who has a qualification one level below the particular qualification in question. For example, see: F Buscha & P Urwin, Estimating the Labour Market Returns to Qualifications Gained in English Further Education Using the Individualised Learner Record (ILR), Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, April 2013; L Dearden, L McGranahan & B Sianesi, An in-depth analysis of the returns to National Technical Qualifications obtained at Level 2, Centre for the Economics of Education, December 2004; G Conlon et al., The Payoff to Technical Qualifications: Reconciling Estimates from Survey and Administrative Data, Centre for Vocational Education Research, November 2017.

with re-entry from worklessness into work. It also considers how the strength of
that association varies between different groups of adults.
 • Section 3 presents patterns of individuals’ sectoral change, discussing the
frequency with which individuals move between sectors as well as the frequency
with which individuals make positive career changes, i.e. sector moves that are
combined with pay rises. It then discusses the extent to which different types
and intensities of education and training are associated with making cross-sector
moves, and how that strength of these associations varies between groups.
 • Section 4 concludes by placing our findings in the context of the current economic crisis and the challenges facing policy makers. It highlights the extent to which
different forms of training can be effective in facilitating labour market re-entry,
especially for those types of workers most affected in the current crisis. It also
discusses the somewhat weaker association between most forms of training (apart
from full-time education) and a person changing industry, and how that could shape
the Government’s strategy on job search and retraining in the weeks and months to
come.

Section 2
Training to return to work
While one-in-five 25-59-year-olds have experienced some form of worklessness over
recent years, one-in-twenty (5 per cent) will have moved into worklessness having
previously recently been in work. This section focuses on the role of education and
training in facilitating job re-entry for that 5 per cent.
Before outlining the relationship between training and job re-entry, this section shows
that education and training among workless adults is, like training patterns for the
wider population, unevenly distributed, especially when it comes to the attainment of
qualifications. While 18 per cent of workless graduates reported having had some form
of training, only 14 per cent of those with mid-level and 11 per cent of those with lower-
level qualifications did. To the extent that education and training are associated with
adults moving from worklessness back into work, these inequalities are a concern.
Only about 12 per cent of out-of-work benefit claimants took up training in 2018/19,
with a majority signing on to shorter-duration courses.
And indeed, our analysis finds that holding constant various personal and work-
related characteristics, training – and its qualification-bearing forms in particular – is
positively and significantly associated with a workless person moving back into work.
These results are particularly striking for two groups which receive some of the lowest
levels of education and training to begin with: younger non-graduate women, and
older non-graduate men.
Nearly one-in-five adults age 25-59 will have experienced worklessness over the previous five years
Figures from Understanding Society shows that 19 per cent of all adults age 25-59
experienced at least one spell of worklessness between 2012 and 2018. This includes 14 per cent who experienced a period of prolonged worklessness (where a respondent
was out of work during each of the four previous years) and an additional 5 per cent who experienced a workless spell (where they were in work three or four years prior
[Page #20]
Can training help workers change their stripes? | Retraining and career change in the UK
but subsequently moved out of work). The left-hand panel in Figure 4 shows that there is substantial variation in the proportion of adults who experience longer-term worklessness, ranging from 1 per cent of younger non-graduate men to 28 per cent of younger non-graduate women.

Long-term workless Workless spell
NOTES: Long-term workless captures those not in work in any of the previous four waves. Those classed as having a workless spell were in work three or four waves prior but subsequently moved out of work. Those experiencing workless spells who return to work are people who were in work in work three or four waves prior, moved out of work over one of the two the previous two waves and then subsequently returned to stable employment (in work in the current wave and at least one of the three following waves). Respondents indicating that they are retired, and those who were in full-time education over the previous three to four waves, have been removed from analysis, as are those who were in full-time education three or four waves prior.SOURCE: RF analysis of ISER, Understanding Society.
And although a far smaller proportion of adults experienced a workless spell, this too varied according to qualification and gender. While 5 per cent of all 25-59-year-olds
experienced a spell of worklessness, only 2 per cent of younger graduate men did,
compared to 6 per cent of younger non-graduate women. Finally, just as qualifications
and gender are correlated with the odds of experiencing a workless spell, they are also
associated with labour market re-entry, i.e. returning to work within two years of moving into worklessness.14 The right-hand panel of Figure 4 shows that, among the 5 per cent of 25-59-year-olds experiencing a workless spell, 57 per cent returned to work within two
14 Meaning they returned to work at least two waves after having first reported being out of work, and stayed in work for at least one of the following three years. This group of ‘returners’ excludes respondents who were retired or full-time students at the time of reporting being out of work.

years, ranging from more than two-thirds (68 per cent) of the 4 per cent of graduates who
experienced a workless spell, to only half of those qualified up to GCSE-equivalent level (5 per cent of whom experienced a workless spell).15
Even among out-of-work adults, those with lower-level qualifications are less likely to access education and training
These gaps are a concern – particularly given that the groups who appear least likely to
return are the same groups that are most likely to move out of work. This section asks
whether education and training have an independent effect on the odds of returning
to work within two years, all else being equal. Before setting out our analytical findings,
we discuss the prevalence of education and training among those out of work in recent
years.

Although data from Understanding Society tells us less about the subject or planned
duration of a particular course, it provides a good overview of how training is distributed
15 Respondents whose job status is listed as ‘on maternity leave’ are in this analysis classed as being employed, given they remain on a contract with their employer. 2.6 per cent of 25-44-year-old women were reported on maternity leave in our 2012-18 sample, including 3.7 per cent of graduates and 2 per cent of non-graduates. By contrast, women whose employment status listed as ‘looking after family or home’ are classed as economically inactive for the purposes of capturing attachment to a firm. 17 per cent of 25-44-year-old women were in this category over the same timeframe, including 9 per cent of 25-44-year-old graduates and 21 per cent of 25-44-year-old non-graduates.
[Page #22]

among workless adults. Figure 5 shows that while 11 per cent of all workless 25-59-year-
olds participated in some form of education or training (see below for a description of
the categories of training we focus on), that figure ranged from 18 per cent of those with
degrees, to 14 per cent among those with mid-level and 11 per cent of those with lower-level qualifications.16 This is noteworthy not least because, as Figure 4 shows, lower-qualified adults are more likely to experience worklessness to begin with.
The patterns above illustrate training and education taken up by out-of-work adults in the
round. We now turn to administrative figures that outline training participation patterns
among benefit claimants specifically. Figures from the Department for Education
(DfE) and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) show that during the 2017/18
academic year, roughly 6 per cent (306,000) of adult benefit claimants aged 19-64 in England took on some form of training.17 The majority of claimants who enrol on a course appear to do so in order to make themselves more employable and find work.18
Putting to one side why a person claiming benefits signed up to a further education course, Figure 6 indicates that the vast majority of courses that learners in receipt of
benefits (“benefit learners”) sign up to are at lower levels of study and shorter in duration.
92 per cent of all courses that benefit claimants signed up to in 2017/18 were either at
Level 2 (GCSE equivalent) or below, and 51 per cent of all courses were both at Level 2 or below and had planned durations of fewer than 30 days.19 20
Although many of these courses are shorter in duration and focused at lower levels
of study, they may still have a positive effect on the chances of an out-of-work benefit
claimant returning to work. We turn to next to the relationship between training and job
re-entry.
16 Excluding respondents who were retired, in full-time education or already on a government training scheme. 17 Or, to put it the other way around, in 2017/18 more than one-in-four (27 per cent) of adult further education learners were on
benefits at the start of their course.
18 Between 2014/15 and 2017/18 (and therefore before Universal Credit covered the majority of benefit claimants), roughly six-in-ten benefit learners were claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) at the start of their course, suggesting that most benefit learners were doing so as part of the efforts to find work. See: Department for Education and Department for Work and Pensions, Further Education for Benefit Claimants, England, 2017/18 Academic Year, June 2019.
19 During 2017/18, 3 per cent of all learners’ aims included a ‘Full Level 2’, 3 per cent a ‘Full Level 3’ and just 2 per cent of courses were at Level 4 or an unassigned level. See: Department for Education and Department for Work and Pensions, Further Education for Benefit Claimants, England, 2017/18 Academic Year, June 2019.
20 While slightly more than one-in-five courses taken up by benefit claimants are focused on a specific academic aim, such as
English, Maths, or English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL), the majority are unspecified in the figures from the DfE and DWP. These could range from general employability skills, to digital skills or skills that are relevant to particular industry, such as retail or customer service. See: Department for Education and Department for Work and Pensions, Further Education for Benefit Claimants, England, 2017/18 Academic Year, June 2019.

When it comes to helping adults back into work, training does have an independent effect upon returning to work after a workless spell
Education and training taken up by (non-retired) out-of-work adults who have previously
left full-time education, including among the majority of benefit claimants who take up
training, is in most cases intended to improve employability and therefore to help find work. But although that is often the intention attached to training for workless adults, particularly in times in economic downturn, there remain question marks around the association between education and training, and returning to work. These include:
1. The statistical significance of the association between training and job re-
entry (holding constant a variety of personal and work-related factors);
2. The extent to which the association between training and job re-entry varies by
training intensity (here measured by length, qualification and full-time study); and,
3. Whether the association between different forms of training
and job re-entry differs for different groups of adults.
[Page #24]
Can training help workers change their stripes? | Retraining and career change in the UK
We use data on training, education and employment from Understanding Society in order
to answer these questions. We test for the association between work re-entry and five
different types of education and training:
1. Any training or education (outside of full-time study): a non-
fulltime course or training programme, including “any part-time
or evening courses, training provided by an employer, day release
schemes, apprenticeships and government training schemes.”
2. Longer-than-median training: a course or programme with a total
duration exceeding the sample median, which is 24 hours.21
3. Training that resulted in a qualification: training resulting in a qualification,
including those courses on which people are waiting for their results.
4. Longer-than-median training with a qualification: training
programme meeting both of the two above criteria.
5. Full-time education: periods in full-time education
since respondents’ last interview.
This research uses logistic regressions to test for the effect that each of our five
different types of education and training have upon the odds of a person returning to stable employment, after having a workless spell.22 We control for a host of personal characteristics, such as age, gender, qualifications, the number of children a person has,
and the region in which they live, as well as for a number of characteristics related to
the type of work a respondent had been in before they moved into worklessness. These
include: occupation, industry, and the number of weekly hours worked.
While we are unable to focus specifically on training with an intention to return to work,
we remove instances where a person says the purpose of their training was health and
safety or for hobbies, as in most cases these intentions are not relevant to attaining a job.
In each regression, the comparison group is respondents who had a workless spell but
did not receive any training, rather than respondents with a workless spell who had some
training, but not the particular form in question.
21 For respondents who reported having more than one training spell in a given year (since their last interview), the total number of
hours spent on training was summed across all spells.
22 Specifically: the odds of a person who was in work three or four waves ago, and was workless over the previous one or two waves,
being in work during the current wave and remaining in work for at least one of the three following waves. Respondents out of work for each of the previous four waves (i.e. long-term workless) are excluded. For all regressions in this section: time period is 2012-18; Controls are: sex, age, age squared, number of children, highest qualification (current), highest qualification (three waves ago), region interacted with whether area is classed as urban or rural, two-digit occupation three waves ago (including if missing), one-digit industry three waves ago (including if missing), weekly job hours three waves ago. Respondents classed as frequent trainers (those who reported any form of training or full-time education in the current wave, three previous waves and forward waves) are removed, as are those who said their training purpose was ‘hobbies’ or ‘health and safety’.

We present statistically significant results in Figure 7 using predictive margins, which
allow us to understand the likelihood of returning to work among similar groups of
people who did and did not participate in training in the previous wave. Holding personal
and work-related factors constant, the relationship between having had any training
and returning to work is positive and significant: Figure 7 shows that we would expect 53 per cent of 25-59-year-olds who experienced a workless spell and did not have any training in the previous year to return to work within two waves, as compared to 68 per
cent of those who did. More specifically, we would expect 71 per cent of adults who had
experienced a workless spell and taking a form of training that resulted in a qualification
to return to work within two years.

It is important not to draw too much from the differences between types of training
shown here. Though our results provide a good independent test of the association
between training and job re-entry, the differences are relatively small, and are not in all
cases statistically significantly different from one another.
Longer and qualification-bearing training is strongly associated with job re-entry among non-graduates
Figure 7 shows an independent effect of training upon work re-entry, controlling for a
host of personal and work-related characteristics, but it tells us less about whether some
groups are likely to benefit more than others. To that end, we ran a series of regressions
to test the association between different forms of training and work re-entry, with our
sample limited to different groups of people.
The predictive margins from these regressions that yielded statistically significant results are shown in Table 2. This shows that while four out of our five training types23 are associated with returning to work among the wider 25-59-year-old population, the
strength of association between training and returning to work is somewhat larger for
more intensive types of training, and substantially larger still among non-graduates. For
instance, absent training we would expect 39 per cent of younger non-graduate women
to return to work; with qualification-bearing training we would expect 62 per cent to do
so. Older non-graduate men have a higher return rate (we would expect 55 per cent to
return absent training) but also appear to benefit from qualification-bearing training:
which is associated with 85 per cent returning to work.
23 Results for full-time education were not statistically significant in any of the models shown in Table 2.

NOTES: Blank cells indicate results that were not statistically significant; cells are shaded according to the percentage difference in the predicted proportions of returning to work without training and with that particular form of training. This table only presents subgroups with significant results. Training undertaken one year prior. Regression analysis tests for the likelihood of returning to work, and being in work for one of the following three waves conditioned on the type of training undertaken. Controls are: sex, age, age squared, number of children, highest qualification (current), highest qualification (three waves ago), region interacted with whether area is classed as urban or rural, two-digit occupation three waves ago (including if missing), one-digit industry three waves ago (including if missing), weekly job hours three waves ago. Respondents classed as frequent trainers (those who reported any form of training or full-time education in the current wave, three previous waves and also future waves) are removed, as are those who said their training purpose was ‘hobbies’ or ‘health and safety’. ‘High-level qualifications’ include qualifications at degree-equivalent level or higher; ‘mid-level qualifications’ include A level-equivalent and sub-degree higher education qualifications; ‘lower-level qualifications’ include qualifications at GCSE-equivalent levels or below. Across all subgroups, there were no statistically significant results for full-time education or an increase in highest reported qualification level.

Policy makers should focus their attention on training to support work re-entry among those who stand to benefit most
The lack of significant results for other groups doesn’t suggest that training will play no
role in helping individuals from these groups to return to work. Instead, the strong results
that we find for non-graduates, and in particular for younger non-graduate women and
older non-graduate men, should provide policy makers with an insight into what types of
training can help those most in need of it.
And there is indeed much room for improvement when it comes to these groups re-
entering work after having a workless spell: over the 2012-18 period, fewer than half (45
[Page #28]
Can training help workers change their stripes? | Retraining and career change in the UK
per cent) of younger non-graduate women did, well below the 57 per cent of the overall
25-59-year-old population that returned.
But while our results show that workless non-graduates stand to benefit from training,
they’re less likely than average to receive it, both overall and when we focus on those
who are out of work. The policy response is not necessarily zero-sum: barring workless
graduates from taking up training is unlikely to help those workless adults in need
of a return to work. However, it should provide insight into how careers advice and
educational resources could be best be marshalled in order to encourage a return to
employment, particularly in the context of the current crisis.
In the current crisis, policy makers will also of course be interested in helping workers
move across sectors. The following section therefore discusses the role of training in
helping adults change industry.
[Page #29]
Can training help workers change their stripes? | Retraining and career change in the UK
Section 3
Training to help change industry
Section 2 outlined the significant role that education and training can play in helping
adults who have had a spell of worklessness return to work. However, in the current
crisis, policy makers will also be concerned with helping workers to move across
sectors.
This section considers the role that education and training have played in the recent
past in terms of 1) helping adults to change the industry in which they work, and 2)
helping adults make a ‘positive’ industry change – where they both change industry and receive a substantial rise (i.e. ten per cent or more) in monthly pay. Given that just 6 per cent of 25-59-year-olds change the industry in which they work from one year to
the next, and only 2 per cent do so while attaining a substantial (10 per cent) monthly
pay rise, it’s unsurprising that we find somewhat weak relationships between most of
our training categories and industry change.
Although most forms of work-related training have a relatively slight association with both industry changes and positive industry changes, full-time education has a substantially larger one. For instance, we would expect 6 per cent of 25-59-year-olds
without any training to achieve a positive industry change over three years, whereas
we would expect 16 per cent of those who had returned to full-time education to do
so. In most cases, the effects are larger for groups who are less likely to receive work-
related training: non-graduates, with younger non-graduate women again benefiting
most.
Positive career changes are a rare phenomenon in the UK
While the previous section focused on the links between training and job re-entry, retraining has typically been thought of as a tool to help (mostly in-work) adults develop a new set of skills and knowledge in order to move into a new sector. Often, it is promoted
as a means to help reallocate workers whose roles were displaced as a result of
economic and/or technological change.
[Page #30]
Can training help workers change their stripes? | Retraining and career change in the UK
Although less prioritised in the UK’s current adult education architecture, there is also
a role for retraining in helping adults in lower-paid sectors to develop the skills and
knowledge that would allow them to progress their pay by moving to a better-paying
sector. For instance, we might think of an adult taking classes at a local college in order
to shift out of retail and into IT – even if this represents more of an ideal than something
commonly pursued. The two approaches to retraining (reallocation and progression)
have often focused on quite different groups of people, with different pay histories, and
different sets of skills and qualifications.
And yet the coronavirus crisis could potentially serve to dovetail the two. To the extent
that the crisis generates a severe downturn in lower-paid and (previously) ‘shutdown’
sectors like hospitality, retail and entertainment, there may be cause to focus on
reallocating a large proportion of previously lower-paid workers into better-paid and more productive roles.24 To say that this is a large-scale challenge is to understate matters: over recent years, 19 per cent of the labour force (6.3 million people) worked in sectors shut down at the start of the crisis.25 There appears a strong possibility that many of these sectors will contract over at least the medium term, while retail is likely to continue declining over the longer term.26 But in the UK there is little recent experience to learn from, with few large-scale retraining and reallocation programmes having occurred in
recent decades.
Figure 8 shows that during more stable conditions (2012-18), we could expect roughly
6 per cent of adults to change the industry in which they work during a given year.
While there does not appear to be much qualification-based difference in this mobility
(for instance 7 per cent of graduates versus 6 per cent of those with lower-level
qualifications), younger people are perhaps unsurprisingly more likely to move industry
than their older counterparts, regardless of qualification level.
Changing industry does not always imply a positive pay outcome: some of the industry changes shown here could reflect churn between lower-paying sectors,27 or even occupational downgrading: where a person moves into a lower-paying role. In fact, much
24 For instance, recent research published by the hiring website, Indeed, found that while job postings across all sectors were, as of 24th July, 57 per cent lower than they had been in the previous year, postings for lower- and mid-paid jobs had dropped off to a larger extent than postings for higher-paid jobs. They also found that workers in hardest-hit sectors, including food preparation and service, beauty, wellness and hospitality recorded the largest increases in clicking on job advertisements outside of their current sector.

including in manufacturing and mining, suggests it is difficult for them to replace their previous level of earnings.28

Therefore, Figure 8 also depicts positive industry changes, defined here as an adult who both changed industry and experienced a 10 per cent monthly pay rise. The proportion
28 There are a number of academic papers that find displaced workers in the US struggle to attain previous levels of pay once in a
new job. Research suggests that some of these pay disparities could be down to their working fewer hours in their new role (which could in fact play into some of the findings presented above, given we measure changes in monthly pay). There are also indications that some pay disparities could be down to differences in average levels of pay between the sector that displaced tend to move from (such as manufacturing, which tends to have a higher-than-average level of unionisation) and the sector they are move to (e.g. a lower-paid service sector). These differences in part are affected by the length and intensity of retraining that a displaced worker has access to. See for instance: F Andersson et al., Does Federally-Funded Job Training Work? Nonexperimental Estimates of WIA Training Impacts Using Longitudinal Data on Workers and Firms, IZA Discussion Paper, September 2013; L Jacobson, R LaLonde & D Sullivan, Is retraining displaced workers a good investment?, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, June 2005. For a UK-based discussion of the challenges retraining schemes face, including the limitations of learning on short courses and the dearth of roles that paid a similar rate to many manual jobs, see: D Thursfield & R Henderson, Participation in lifelong learning: reality or myth? issues arising from a United Kingdom coalfield closure, Journal of Vocational Education and Training 56(1), 2004; E Keep & K Mayhew, Evaluating the Assumptions that Underlie Training Policy, in J Ahier & G Esland, Education, Training and the Future of Work 1: social, political and economic contexts of policy development.

of adults that achieved this is quite small: while we can expect 6 per cent of 25-59-year-
olds to change industry in a given year, only one-third of them (fewer than 2 per cent of
the total) both changed industry and attained a significant monthly pay rise. And once again, the proportion achieving these positive sector changes differs more so by age than qualification: roughly 2 per cent of both graduate and non-graduate young men and
women achieved this outcome, as compared to 1 per cent of their older counterparts.
Apart from full-time education, the relationship between most forms of training and moving industry appears weak
We first test for the effect that education and training have upon the odds of a person
changing sector – saying nothing of whether that sector change yielded a pay rise.
Because both completing training and education spells, and finding a new job, can take time, we test for the association between training that a person took two years prior upon the odds of that person working in a different industry from the industry they worked in three years prior.29 As with the regression analyses in Section 2, we control for host of personal and work-related characteristics and in each case, the comparator
group is people who had no training. We also removed participants who we class as
‘frequent trainers’ as well as those who indicated that the purpose of their training was a
hobby or a health and safety requirement.
We would ultimately expect a stronger association between training and industry changes (and in particular, training and positive industry changes) in the event that a person took on a course or training spell with the specific intention of developing
the skills and knowledge that would allow them to move into a new sector. The
Understanding Society question that asks respondents about the purpose of their
training spell does include the option: “to prepare you for a job you might do in the
future”. However, sample size prevents us from limiting our regression analyses only
to respondents who selected this particular option. Moreover, respondents who participated in full-time education are not asked a similar ‘purpose’ question.30
Putting to one side these more detailed concerns around intentionality, Figure 9 shows
that the relationship between industry change and most forms of training appears
somewhat weak (even though the figures here are all statistically significant at the 95 per
cent confidence level or higher). We would expect 15 per cent of adults who had not had
29 We ran a number of regression models that tested different training and job change timelines, for instance, lagging training by
one wave and assessing job changes between two waves. The models presented in this report consistently yielded the greatest number of significant associations between training and industry change/positive industry change. This is perhaps unsurprising given that there could be lag between a person finishing education/training and finding a new job.
30 Given the cost and effort of returning to full-time education, we might expect that adults who returned did so intending to change career, though we cannot be certain. Moreover, it is difficult to disentangle the relationship between industry change and taking time out for full-time education, and the relationship between industry change and a person being so driven to change industry that they returned to full-time study.

any training or education two years ago to be working in a different industry from three
years ago; a figure that rises to 18 per cent for those who had longer or qualification-
bearing forms of training. The clear exception here is full-time education: a person who
was in full-time education two years ago had a 31 per cent chance of changing industry.

Of course, the effects of training will vary both by training type and across different
groups of adults. Table 3 shows these results across subgroups, demonstrating the
greatest effects of full-time education are for non-graduate men and women.
For instance, we would expect 13 per cent of older non-graduate who did not have any
education or training two years ago to report working in a different industry but 48 per
cent of older non-graduate women who had full-time education two years ago to be a in a
different industry – a 35 percentage point difference.

It is important to note that the smaller scale, and in some cases seeming absence, of
a statistically significant association between training and changing industry does not
mean training can’t be effective for helping people change their careers. It could instead
reflect other factors that constrain people’s ability to move jobs – for instance, region,
security or caring responsibilities. And of course, it could reflect the fact that the training
being undertaken will in many cases not be well targeted at this outcome. Some training
may be targeted at the broader goal of obtaining a pay rise within one’s current job. While
such progression is less the focus of this study, we explore the effects of training on pay
rises in Box 1.

Changing industry on its own can be a sign of a positive career move: for instance, doing
so can allow a person whose industry has shrunk, or whose occupation has become

These results reflect the fact that few people make these sector changes, or take on intensive training to do so, to begin
Impressive though these results are, it’s important to put some of the more discouraging
findings (i.e. where there is only a small statistically significant association between
training and making a positive career change) into context.
First, only a small number of adults (one per cent of 25-59-year-olds) take on the intensive
full-time study that we have found most likely to foster a career change (see Figure 12
in the annex). Within that, an even smaller number of lower-qualified adults (who would
stand to benefit most from making a positive career change) do so. Second, and perhaps
relatedly, only a small proportion of people (fewer than 2 per cent of adults in our sample)
make a positive career change in any given year.
In other words, the UK does not have a large amount of population-wide evidence on
either career changes or the training likely to support them, let alone evidence on the link between the two. Part of the challenge here is that while our analyses remove individuals
who said that their training was not intended to advance their career (i.e. it was classed
as a hobby or as a health and safety), we cannot say that the training we do assess was
specifically intended to help them change career. Practically, this is because we’re unable
to identify such instances in the data. But more substantively, our inability to test this
stems from the fact that there has been no large-scale retraining programme in recent
years in the UK. Without large-scale instructive lessons to draw on, policy makers aiming
to develop a sizeable national retraining programme that would help lower-qualified
adults make a positive career change in the wake of the coronavirus crisis are faced with
a difficult task.
One the one hand, the prospect of placing hundreds of thousands of displaced workers
from lower-skilled and lower-paid jobs into full-time education seems unrealistic. This is
not only because the costs involved in providing education and living costs support to
learners will be high, but also because employment outcomes will be uncertain (i.e. we
do not have a system that allows for matching between training and jobs at a large scale).
And workers themselves may be unwilling or unable to bear the risks involved in exiting
the jobs market and returning to full-time study for a prolonged period of time.
On the other hand, simply conceding that displaced workers will flounder without a
chance to develop the skills required for a new role seems untenable too. Over time,
their skills will depreciate along with their incomes. The following section discusses this
dilemma, setting out the challenges and opportunities for education and training policy’s
role in fostering better employment outcomes in the wake of the current crisis.
[Page #39]

Section 4
Conclusions and reflections for policy
This section concludes by placing our findings in the context of the current economic
crisis and the challenges facing policy makers. We argue that policy makers should
avoid retraining policies that are centred on specific pre-crisis challenges, or narrow
groups of workers, and instead focus their current efforts on tackling the high
unemployment precipitated by the coronavirus crisis. This should include the swift provision of training that has proven effective in helping adults re-enter work from
worklessness, and efforts to link retraining to achievable (and desirable) job creation
initiatives.
Policy makers should prioritise policies that would help fend off a forthcoming employment crisis
Although the narrative around retraining policy in the UK has tended to centre on the
needs of workers moving out of declining sectors like manufacturing, this report has
shown that – even before the coronavirus crisis – there were an even larger number of
workers moving out of lower-paid sectors like retail and hospitality into unemployment.
In the early stages of the crisis, it became clear that lower-paid workers in in-person
services like retail, entertainment and hospitality were bearing the brunt of the labour
market downturn. There are concerns that these sectors will continue to struggle for some time,32 with retail likely to experience a continued downturn over the longer term.33 As such, policy makers should focus on tackling the unemployment crisis that is likely
to intensify in future months. This will require them to move beyond calls for retraining
schemes focused on a narrow group of workers.
32 For instance, four-in-ten hospitality and leisure workers and more than one-in-ten non-essential retail workers remain furloughed on the JRS, with fears that a substantial portion will lose their jobs once the furlough scheme begins to wind down from August and ends in October.

Can training help workers change their stripes? | Retraining and career change in the UK
In some cases, this will involve training and education that help adults re-enter work. In
others, it will require efforts to help adults change the sector that they work in. Improving
the education and training offer so that lower-qualified adults in lower-paid roles could
transition into better-paid and broadly speaking, higher-quality, jobs has long been
needed – and this includes reforms to the adult education system in England (see Box 2).
Unfortunately, the recent past, covered in this report, does not leave policy makers with a
clear roadmap to help get them there.
There are no ready-made answers for policy makers looking to design a large-scale retraining system at pace
As we’ve just set out, the good news is that the evidence shows that training can help
adults bounce back into the labour market. The less good news is that doing so may
prove far more difficult in the current crisis, with few job vacancies in labour-intensive
sectors with low barriers to entry (such as hospitality, leisure and retail). More challenging
still will be efforts to help transition workers out of these struggling sectors and into new
roles: of the forms of education and training that we were able to test for, only full-time
education had a large and significant association with a person changing industry.
This is not necessarily proof that part-time or indeed shorter but qualification-bearing
courses do little to facilitate career changes. Rather, it in all likelihood reflects the fact
that only a small portion of UK adults make such career changes, and an even smaller
portion (fewer than 2 per cent) still make big career changes that have a positive effect
on their income. While there are likely to be a number of reasons as to why so few adults
make career changes, we suspect that barriers to education and training play a key
role. In particular, barriers that prevent adults from taking up the types of education
and training that are intensive enough to facilitate a career change (see Box 2). In other
words, without reform, the system we currently have is unlikely to facilitate retraining
linked to sectoral reallocation on the timescales we are looking at.

While looking to the past for lessons on how to facilitate career change brings with
it challenges, so too does looking abroad. International experiences with retraining,
discussed briefly in Box 3, could leave policy makers with two very different approaches –
both of which bring substantial levels of difficulty and risk in a UK context.
For instance, the tripartite model of coordination that has underpinned large-scale
retraining and job matching for decades if not longer in many northern European
countries has historically been fragile if not absent in the UK, particularly with regard to the sectors affected by the current crisis.36 By contrast, the less coordinated approaches taken up in recent years in the US have placed a substantial amount of risk onto
individuals. In other words, importing retraining systems from abroad is, in most cases,
neither likely to be possible nor desirable.

In the short-to-medium term, government should focus training on lower-qualified unemployed people seeking to return to work, and develop sector-focused job creation initiatives
The Chancellor’s Plan for Jobs, announced last month, featured a number of proposals
to support employment and training among young people (such as a temporary jobs
scheme and a boost to the small number of existing traineeships), as well as support for
unemployed people more generally (for example, doubling the number of work coaches
at DWP Jobcentres and offering additional support to those unemployed for longer than three months).43
Alongside these initiatives, policy makers should look to training specifically as one way
to tackle the high levels of unemployment that we are likely to be facing. They should
recognise the positive role that training, particularly when linked to a qualification,
can play in helping lower-qualified workers re-enter a job after a spell of worklessness,
particularly non-graduates (and younger women and older men within them). In doing so,
they should also consider how pre-existing recommendations on reforms to the post-18
education further education system (as set out by the Augar Review in 2019) can help
increase access to training opportunities while reducing the financial risks that adults
often face when returning to education.
Turning from support to re-enter work to the broader question of sectoral reallocation,
given little existing UK architecture or experience of success around retraining, the
Government should focus on linking it directly to job creation that aligns with longer-
term policy goals. A recent Resolution Foundation report called for investment in social
care and ‘green jobs’ – specifically, retrofitting houses to become more energy efficient – as necessary for avoiding lasting high unemployment in the years to come. 44
These roles have relatively low barriers to entry for the types of workers most at risk of
losing their jobs during this crisis, meaning training would be both specific and shorter
in nature, requiring weeks rather than months or years of study. Moreover, these roles
have the benefit of being geographically dispersed. And crucially, the availability of a job
in a new sector at the end of training would be baked in as part of a government-led job
creation initiative, as compared to more diffuse retraining investments. To some degree,
government playing a role in job creation could help overcome the lack of tripartite
43 These include an ‘apprenticeships bonus’ offering firms an additional £2,000 for taking on new starters age 16-24 as an apprentice and £1,500 if the new starter is over 25, £101 million to fund 18-19-year-olds to take ‘high-value’ further education courses at Levels 2 and 3 “when there are not employment opportunities available to them”; £17 million for sector-based work academy placements, which offer vocational training in a specific field as a well as a job interview; and a doubling of the number of work coaches in Jobcentres.

coordination that prevails in the UK and currently hinders efforts to develop retraining
schemes akin to those in countries like Denmark.
To the extent that these initiatives will take time to get up and running, and are unlikely to
provide a sufficient number of jobs for out-of-work adults, government should redouble
efforts to support employment in the sectors worst affected by this crisis. This could
include a recent Resolution Foundation proposal for a ‘Job Protection Scheme,’ which would effectively offer a temporary wage subsidy to jobs in the hardest-hit sectors.45
The unemployment effects of the coronavirus crisis have a cast a harsh light on
pre-existing challenges around training to support job re-entry and career changes,
challenges that have long prevailed in the UK. Helping adults through the current crisis
will therefore depend on addressing these longstanding challenges while also ensuring a
sufficient supply of jobs on the ground. This must include providing the training that this
report has shown can be effective in helping adults re-enter work, and linking retraining
to achievable (and desirable) job creation initiatives.
45 This would include all of the hospitality and recreation sectors, plus the parts of the retail sector most affected by the lockdown. See: N Cominetti, L Gardiner & H Slaughter, The Full Monty: Facing up to the challenge of the coronavirus labour market crisis, Resolution Foundation, June 2020.
