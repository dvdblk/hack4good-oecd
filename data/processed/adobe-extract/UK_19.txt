Impact of higher cost of living question
A new question was asked to participants in the 2022 survey to understand how they perceive that the ongoing cost of living crisis in the UK has impacted their use of the internet and other online activities:
Given the increasing cost of living in the UK driven by higher prices on goods and services such as food, energy and fuel, which of the following apply to you?
1. I will have to give up internet or mobile data to be able to afford my other bills
2. I will have to look for cheaper internet or mobile data plans to be able to afford my other bills
3. I have already taken steps to reduce costs associated with internet or mobile data usage to allow me to continue to afford my other bills
4. I will have to make more use of public Wi-Fi hotspots to save my mobile data
5. I will need to rely more heavily on libraries or community centres for device usage or free Wi-Fi
6. I will not be able to afford to start using an internet or mobile data plan of my own
7. The rising cost of living has no impact on my ability to go online
In the report, "NET: The rising cost-of-living will impact my ability to go online" is a combination of codes 1-6.
